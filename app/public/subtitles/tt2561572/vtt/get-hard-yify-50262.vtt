00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Greetings from Martin's Comedy Movies.

2
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.966
<i>Buenos dias, Cecelio!</i>

3
00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.884
Sir, I'm just saying, your ad says,
"Bad credit, no problem."

4
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.485
So can you define "no problem"?

5
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.001
Because me not getting this loan
is a problem.

6
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.322
I'm sorry. That's why I'm asking you to...

7
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.251
- Sorry, Daddy.
- That's okay, but that's just nasty.

8
00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.725
No, no, no. Not you, sir.

9
00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.930
Listen to this. What if I have everything
I need except the $30,000?

10
00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.606
Keep calm? Sir. Sir. Can you...?

11
00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.762
Ma'am. Okay. I couldn't tell.

12
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.804
Aren't you supposed to be a predatory lender?
Then prey on me!

13
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.724
Okay? You're a lion, I'm a gazelle.

14
00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.850
Okay, fine. Fine. Do you know what?
I'm putting my daughter on the phone.

15
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.089
Explain to her why she has to go
to school in a gangbanger school district...

16
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.766
where they're murdering kids. Murdering!

17
00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.247
Here, you tell her.

18
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.890
Hey, baby, do what I showed you.

19
00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.291
- Why do you want me to get murdered?
- No.

20
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.125
"Murdered.
Why do you want me to get murdered?"

21
00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.207
<i>They hung UP-</i>

22
00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.806
Because you're not doing what I told you to.

23
00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.442
- You are sick.
- I'm not sick. It's called desperate.

24
00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.085
Baby, all we have to do is keep saving.

25
00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.766
I just need some love.
Can you just hug me?

26
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.251
Just kiss me?

27
00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.044
- Any better?
- Awkward.

28
00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.448
Come on.
Get yourjuice, and your book bag.

29
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.284
I told you to hit the bull's-eye.

30
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.084
How hard is it to cry, Makayla?

31
00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.811
"Murder. Murder."

32
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.841
- Watch out.
- Move, old man.

33
00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.844
Is that weed?

34
00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.289
Hey, I want you to be safe, okay?

35
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.683
Listen to me. Listen to me.
You're not gonna be at this school forever.

36
00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.808
Daddy's working on it. I love you.

37
00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.849
- I love you too.
- All right.

38
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.083
- Don't worry.
- Kind of hard not to worry. You're my daughter.

39
00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.963
- Come on, dear.
- Hey, watch it!

40
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.081
Matter of time. Matter of time.

41
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.250
- I kick, James!
- Yeah.

42
00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.561
Move!

43
00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.161
- Hey, babe!
- Watch this, honey.

44
00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.367
Watch this.

45
00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.763
Whoo! Look at that kick!

46
00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.200
Good job, James!

47
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.963
Oh...

48
00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.570
Good job, guys.
We're all working hard today. Mm.

49
00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:00.846
Ah...

50
00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.729
You looked good out there,
my big strong fiance.

51
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.771
Jaoa says I need to focus on
bringing my power into the world.

52
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.291
Fuck!

53
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.883
Maybe I can help.

54
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.885
You...

55
00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.806
are a great man, James King.

56
00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.450
Do me on the new house.

57
00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.651
Did it get bigger?

58
00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.883
Yeah, it did, baby.

59
00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.964
It's the dick of a king. It's your scepter.

60
00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.566
- No.
- Yeah.

61
00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.125
No, I mean the house.

62
00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.444
The king needs his castle, James.

63
00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.045
Ten thousand square feet.

64
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.571
Seven bedrooms.

65
00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.041
Two kitchens.

66
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.727
Infinity pool.

67
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.649
Is that a guesthouse for the guesthouse?

68
00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.962
Well, in case our guests have guests.

69
00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.926
And you have so many friends, baby.

70
00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.969
Don't you, Mr. Popular?

71
00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.207
So powerful.

72
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.051
So you don't think it's too much house,
do you?

73
00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:33.725
James, seriously?

74
00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.281
I mean, you wanna raise a family
in this house?

75
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.168
- Well, yes.
- In this...

76
00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:40.720
.“house?

77
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.086
No!

78
00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.846
No, this house is a shithole!

79
00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:47.601
Look...

80
00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:52.089
there's winners
and there's losers, James.

81
00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.086
It's what drives this country.

82
00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.891
All right? People look at what you have...

83
00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.644
and they want it.

84
00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.447
They want your huge house.

85
00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:05.926
And they want...

86
00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:09.325
your hot, hot...

87
00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.801
wife.
So hot.

88
00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.405
- Who's the king?
- I am.

89
00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.767
Are you the king?
How much money you gonna make today?

90
00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.605
- Enough to choke a baby.
- That's right.

91
00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.491
- Yeah, are you a winner?
- Yes, I'm a winner.

92
00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:26.689
- Whose tits are these?
- They're my tits.

93
00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:27.927
These are the king's tits!

94
00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.764
- The king's titties.
- That's right.

95
00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.402
- Is it a king's dick?
- It's slightly above average.

96
00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:36.291
Yeah? You gotta stake your claim, James.

97
00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.602
Yes! You gotta stake it!

98
00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.524
Stake my claim.

99
00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.169
Oh, come on, baby. Do me like a billionaire!

100
00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.007
You. You, right there, with the hat.

101
00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.482
<i>I</i> don't care.

102
00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.569
Hey, boss man, did you get that text?

103
00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.927
I sent you a text yesterday.

104
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.964
Surprise!

105
00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.247
The boss is here.

106
00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:21.006
Maybe it's time that we act
like we got work to do.

107
00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:25.405
We got 4O cars and we got eight hours
of the air down here!

108
00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:28.246
James King, Wealthrop Funds.

109
00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.563
Transfer 100 million
from my client accounts.

110
00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:35.964
I'd like to put a buy order
on Bradway Chemical, up to 7.50.

111
00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.802
I've got a good feeling about clean coal.

112
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.240
Clean the roofs, Mike.

113
00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:47.565
You don't think people can see those?
I hired you to do one thing.

114
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.047
That's be tall.

115
00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:53.326
All right, great job.

116
00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.443
Hey there, Jamesy,
that was quite a ride, man.

117
00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.602
That was like third quarter 2012.

118
00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.445
- It's a real pleasure to watch you work, sir.
- Thanks, Leo.

119
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.171
Yeah.
How about that, you knew my name!

120
00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:05.689
I love it.

121
00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:11.608
So I shorted gas and went long on coal.

122
00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:14.843
It wasn't quite the return
I was hoping for, but...

123
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.161
James.

124
00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:20.689
You made my company $28 million today.

125
00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:24.686
Now, to celebrate, I would like to give you
an early wedding present...

126
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.331
partner.
Ah.

127
00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.682
Sir, thank you.

128
00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:31.121
Gayle, a minute.

129
00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.844
James, this is the moment
when you cross that threshold...

130
00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.486
and join America's most elite.

131
00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:45.530
Anything you desire,
anything you want is yours.

132
00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:46.966
I'm ready for it.

133
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.968
You know, I bought an island
in Cape Verde.

134
00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:52.124
An entire island.

135
00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.000
You can too.

136
00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:57.523
I would love to.
We could be island neighbors.

137
00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:00.966
You could swim over
and borrow a cup of gold.

138
00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.167
[RAUGHS]

139
00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.885
Yeah.

140
00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:09.646
You know, and to think
it all started with this.

141
00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.211
I still have that computer.

142
00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:15.365
It reminds me
of my humble beginnings.

143
00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.561
How I built this company
with my own two hands.

144
00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.245
Just me, that computer...

145
00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.841
and an $8 million loan from my father.

146
00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.684
You really did it all on your own.

147
00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.485
Very inspiring, sir.

148
00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:38.201
Now, listen, I want you to drop
this "sir" nonsense.

149
00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:40.921
You are marrying my daughter,
for Pete's sake.

150
00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.570
[RAUGHS]

151
00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:44.250
I want you to call me "Dad."

152
00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.244
Really? Dad?

153
00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:48.765
- Mm-hm.
- Heh.

154
00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:50.843
That feels very good.

155
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.765
My real father never had time for me.

156
00:11:55.440 --> 00:12:00.446
He shipped me off to boarding school in
London with the Murdochs and the bin Ladens.

157
00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.764
Of course, that was before...

158
00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:08.208
I mean, we knew they cheated in soccer,
but, had no idea...

159
00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:09.407
you know...

160
00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.530
But if I could choose a dad...

161
00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:16.128
Hey, you know something,
you're family now, kid.

162
00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.165
Okay, then.

163
00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:23.485
Oh, boy.

164
00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:28.041
Motherfucker.

165
00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:49.561
- Mr. King.
- Aah! Aah!

166
00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:50.881
Take whatever you want!

167
00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:52.286
- Please!
- It's the hood.

168
00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.204
- Hey! It's Darnell.
- Help!

169
00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:57.005
- Help! Help!
- Stop! Mr. King. No!

170
00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.090
- Oh, dear Lord. Someone help me!
- Stop it! You're being ridiculous!

171
00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.924
Stop! Look at me.

172
00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:03.686
It's me.

173
00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.765
I 9911 your keys!

174
00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:07.331
Oh.

175
00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:09.482
Yes! I see you.

176
00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:12.329
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

177
00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.329
- Here you go.
- Oh.

178
00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.324
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

179
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.641
And, uh, just so you know, I would have done
the same thing if you were white.

180
00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.450
That's good to know.

181
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.126
Hey, Mr. King.

182
00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:25.446
Um...

183
00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:29.764
While I got you out here, I just wanna...
I just wanna talk to you for a second.

184
00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:32.002
I've been washing your
car for two years now...

185
00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:35.647
and I can tell you're the type of man
who likes the best of everything.

186
00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:40.170
So as owner and CEO
of Hollywood Luxury Bubbles...

187
00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:45.042
I wanted to offer you
an exclusive platinum lifetime wash card...

188
00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:47.807
for $30,000.

189
00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:49.810
Now, before you say anything...

190
00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:54.170
think about the type of money
that you'll save with this investment.

191
00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:56.766
Well, actually the time value
of money is such that...

192
00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:00.288
if I were to put that same amount
in my own fund...

193
00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:05.049
in 23 years' time,
I'd have in excess of $3 million.

194
00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:06.247
Wow. Yeah.

195
00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:09.768
With that rate of return, I could buy
a new car every time it gets dirty.

196
00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:12.048
- Isn't that impressive?
- Amazing, Mr. King.

197
00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:14.248
That's the magic of compounded interest.

198
00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:17.967
You see, I didn't get to where I am today
by asking for handouts.

199
00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.724
But by hard work.

200
00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.441
And today, that hard work paid off...

201
00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:26.127
as I was just named partner
in my firm.

202
00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:27.521
Mr. King, that is...

203
00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:30.451
- Hey. That is amazing.
- Thank you so much.

204
00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:33.207
- That is...
- Thank you.

205
00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:35.563
That's amazing. Mr. King, listen to me.

206
00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.127
I'm one of the hardest workers
you'll ever meet.

207
00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:41.443
I mean, that's why I'm down here
power-washing cars every day.

208
00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:44.001
I just felt with this face-to-face
that you would...

209
00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.881
That you would wanna help
a fellow business owner and job creator.

210
00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:52.011
I am helping you. By saying no.

211
00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:55.647
- Mr. King, that's...
- That way, you can make it on your own.

212
00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:59.691
Okay. Mr. King, I have a lot of people
helping me that way already. And... And...

213
00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:03.447
Great. Then you have a plan for success.

214
00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:04.965
Why didn't you tell me that?

215
00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:09.927
You see, everyone,
whether we're born rich or poor...

216
00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:11.606
or white...

217
00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:13.922
or miscellaneous...

218
00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.730
who we become...

219
00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:18.565
is based on our own decisions.
It's simple as that.

220
00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:21.206
You know who else started in a garage?

221
00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:24.648
Hewlett-Packard. So you're in good company.

222
00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:27.647
- And on that note...
- No, Mister...

223
00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:30.929
- You don't have to give me that much, Mr. King.
- Hold on, hold on.

224
00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:34.204
- You don't have to give me that much.
- Hold on. There we go.

225
00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:35.771
You really don't need...

226
00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:37.126
There you go.

227
00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:38.361
There's a start.

228
00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:42.844
Mr. King, please.
I feel like you just haven't given me...

229
00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:49.043
Success is a mindset!

230
00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:08.521
Hi, everyone!

231
00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:09.966
Hi.

232
00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:14.808
Thank you so much
for celebrating our engagement with us.

233
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.047
Excuse me.

234
00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:18.841
Excuse me.

235
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.968
Excuse me. Everyone, just "shh."

236
00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.288
Shh! You need to "shh." Senator.

237
00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.645
Shh! Shh.

238
00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:26.961
Yellow tie.

239
00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:29.164
I see you.

240
00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:31.961
Thank you.

241
00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:35.125
James, I love you...

242
00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:37.567
and I can't wait to be married to you.

243
00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.963
Aw.

244
00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:44.569
And because you rock my world...

245
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.240
' got you this!

246
00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.165
Oh!

247
00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:50.522
Hey! Wow.

248
00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:56.245
This is beautiful.

249
00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:59.486
- But not as beautiful as you, Alissa.
- Aw.

250
00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:01.881
- I love you.
- I love you.

251
00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:07.010
Being with you and in front
of all of our friends and family here...

252
00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:11.051
I just wanna say,
I'm the luckiest man in the world!

253
00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:12.406
Play something!

254
00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:13.925
- Oh.
- Oh, oh.

255
00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:16.765
Well, actually, there's one more part
to your present!

256
00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:19.083
It's Mr. John Mayer!

257
00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:21.408
- John Mayer!
- Thank you, thank you.

258
00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:23.246
Hey, everybody!

259
00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.210
Who's John Mayer?

260
00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:29.604
I just wanna say, thank you,
James and Alissa, for making me...

261
00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:31.171
Shut up!

262
00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:35.408
A part of your special night.
Thank you very much.

263
00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:38.325
I wanna thank you personally
for the Bradway Chemical buy.

264
00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.165
- Oh, sure. Ha-ha-ha.
- There's nothing I love more than making money.

265
00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:44.881
Not even chicks. Or dudes. I fuck anything.

266
00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:49.164
You ever seen 100 women get wet
at the same time? Watch this.

267
00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:53.249
Aw.

268
00:17:55.760 --> 00:18:01.324
<i>Fathers, be good to your daughters.</i>

269
00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:05.202
<i>Daughters will love like you do.</i>

270
00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:10.441
<i>Girls become lovers.</i>

271
00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:12.848
<i>Who turn into mothers.</i>

272
00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:19.563
<i>So, mothers
Be good to your daughters too</i>

273
00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:21.688
John, lay back.
I'm gonna take a few bars.

274
00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:22.887
Yeah.

275
00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:34.846
Hey! Step aside, FBI! Back up!

276
00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:37.402
Everybody, step aside!

277
00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:40.365
- James King.
- Yeah?

278
00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:43.922
You're under arrest for 43 counts of fraud
and 3O counts of embezzlement.

279
00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:47.129
- That's impossible.
- That's what they all say. Get him out of here!

280
00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:49.169
I know. This is some kind of joke.

281
00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:52.403
Because if this isn't,
this is the worst nightmare imaginable.

282
00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:53.971
Yeah! Ha-ha-ha. Finally.

283
00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:56.964
- Are you getting this?
- Shit, yeah! Get out of the way!

284
00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:00.329
- I swear I don't know what any of this is about!
- Mm-hm.

285
00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:03.327
Don't worry, son! I'll take care of it.

286
00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:04.811
Let's go.

287
00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:10.681
- Gayle, call my lawyer.
- My party!

288
00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:13.286
Looks like you could use a friend right now.

289
00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:15.204
What the fuck?

290
00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:23.967
The charges are securities fraud
and embezzlement.

291
00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:28.284
- These transaction records prove you're guilty.
- I've never seen these. These are fakes!

292
00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:31.484
If you go to court,
they're gonna kick your ass. Take the plea.

293
00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.091
- Dad!
- Take the plea.

294
00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:36.050
You'll be out in a year
and in the best shape of your life.

295
00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:40.046
No. I have faith that the justice system
will exonerate me.

296
00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:43.562
And that the jury will put aside
their bias and see the truth:

297
00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:46.007
That I didn't steal money from people.

298
00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.202
And that I am no Bernie Madoff.

299
00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:52.046
A verdict is expected today
in the "mini-Madoff" trial of James King.

300
00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:00.124
I lost everything! Fuck you!

301
00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:01.770
I didn't do it!

302
00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:07.243
For too long,
wealthy white-collar offenders like you...

303
00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:11.206
have gotten a free pass with light sentences
in minimum-security prison...

304
00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:14.887
while working Americans have suffered.
Well, that ends today, Mr. King.

305
00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:18.203
I sentence you
to the harshest penalty allowed:

306
00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:20.528
Ten years in a maximum-security prison.

307
00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:25.726
You have 30 days
to get your affairs in order.

308
00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:29.089
Just run them over!

309
00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:31.083
I can't go to jail. I'll die in there.

310
00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:34.562
That's not gonna happen, James,
because I'm gonna put my investigators...

311
00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:38.042
on this twenty-four-seven
until we find out who really did this.

312
00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:40.123
Just stay in county lines with that thing on.

313
00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:42.886
Otherwise, the U.S. Marshals
will be down there pronto.

314
00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:46.522
Son, I want you to stay strong.
Do you hear me?

315
00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:48.211
I Will.

316
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.448
I'll be so strong for you, Dad.

317
00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:59.211
Why me?

318
00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:18.288
I have to leave the country!

319
00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:37.050
It took so long to ring me up, I had to miss
my waxing appointment. I feel like a gorilla.

320
00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.611
It's summer too.

321
00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:41.445
I can't believe this is happening to me.

322
00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:44.365
- It's like they don't recognize you anymore.
- Thank you. Yes.

323
00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:45.567
Alissa!

324
00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:47.768
Hey! It's me, James.

325
00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:50.882
I know. What are you doing?

326
00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:52.611
Why do you look like that?

327
00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:55.081
Just eat your fucking salads.

328
00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:57.641
I'll fucking kill you if you say anything.

329
00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:59.131
Hi.

330
00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:01.124
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi.

331
00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:02.611
I came up with a great idea.

332
00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:06.321
Let's just run away! Some place
that no one would ever think to find us.

333
00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:08.130
Mexico.

334
00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:11.770
Let's just leave this material world behind.

335
00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:14.082
Live in a one-bedroom shack.

336
00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:15.969
- Oh, God.
- Yes.

337
00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:18.926
- You could sell Chiclets on the road.
- What?

338
00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:21.687
Look, we'll work out the details later.

339
00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:23.330
- We should get out of here.
- No!

340
00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:26.370
- I already cut off my ankle bracelet.
- No! No.

341
00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:27.567
Let's go.

342
00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:28.801
- James, no.
- What?

343
00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:30.485
- No! I'm leaving you.
- Why?

344
00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.329
But I thought you loved me forever.

345
00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:37.326
Well, now you know.

346
00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:42.321
Alissa.

347
00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:45.807
<i>This is the U.S. Marshal Service.</i>

348
00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:49.646
<i>James King, exit the building
and surrender to custody immediately.</i>

349
00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:50.887
Oh, shit!

350
00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:54.851
Hey, guys. He's in there.

351
00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:58.885
Why are you arresting me?

352
00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:03.967
I am but a simple bartender from Belize.

353
00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:05.167
Wait, no. Mexico.

354
00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:07.568
Call my lawyer in Tijuana.

355
00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:20.844
Shit!

356
00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:23.680
- What the fuck is that?! Get off!
- It's me! It's me!

357
00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:25.211
- Mr. King?
- Yes.

358
00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:27.842
You scared the shit out of me, man.

359
00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:30.726
What you doing in the trunk?

360
00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:33.167
I just needed a place to regroup.

361
00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:35.527
You know, fresh start.

362
00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:37.370
Okay. Hey. Let me help you out, man.

363
00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:42.805
Fuck you, King!

364
00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:45.691
- I lost everything because of you!
- I didn't do it!

365
00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:47.640
Fuck!

366
00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:49.211
Fuck someone!

367
00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:50.885
Fuck a tit!

368
00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:53.050
Fuck a tit hard!

369
00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:55.322
For the love of Alan Greenspan.

370
00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:58.724
Fuck! My life is ruined.

371
00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:03.922
I venture you've heard
that I'm going to prison.

372
00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:08.446
Yeah. No, we all did. I just didn't
wanna bring it up first, that's all.

373
00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:11.126
Come on. They're probably sending you
to some Club Fed prison.

374
00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:13.522
You'll be playing tennis and golf, you know.

375
00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:18.971
- I'm going to be attending San Quentin.
- They're sending you to San Quentin?

376
00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:20.367
Oh.

377
00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:22.210
- What?
- Oh, God!

378
00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:23.800
They fucking in San Quentin.

379
00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:26.487
- Oh.
- Everybody gets the dick.

380
00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:28.045
I don't want it.

381
00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:31.409
You're not gonna get it.
You'll be in for three months.

382
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.968
I'm gonna be there for 10 years.

383
00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:36.885
Goddamn! Ten years?

384
00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:39.930
- Oh! Oh!
- Why do you say it like that?

385
00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:42.162
It's not as bad as I've heard, is it?

386
00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:45.490
If you heard everybody fucking, it is.
That's how bad it is.

387
00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:47.005
I didn't hear that part.

388
00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:49.368
They might as well call it
San Fucking, man.

389
00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:54.249
I don't wish that on my worst enemy.
You talking about bad? That's bad.

390
00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.490
You should know.

391
00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.490
I'm sorry to remind you.

392
00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:01.648
What are you talking about?

393
00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:03.882
Well, the fact that you went to prison.

394
00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:05.884
The fact that I went to prison?

395
00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:08.526
Yes. Look, you did your time.

396
00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:12.730
You paid your debt. And we as society...

397
00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:15.121
should welcome you back, and we do.

398
00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:17.928
You and I are exactly the same.

399
00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:20.128
Except you can't vote, ever.

400
00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:24.687
Just before I get to another level of anger,
Mr. King, tell me for giggles...

401
00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:26.842
how do you know I went to prison?
It's simple.

402
00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:29.560
Statistical analysis is what I do.
Here's the deal:

403
00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:33.566
One out of three black men will find themselves
incarcerated during their lifetime.

404
00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:35.489
- Imagine a pizza, okay?
- Okay.

405
00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:36.880
There are three pieces.

406
00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:39.966
Three black pieces.

407
00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:46.851
One of those pieces of pizza will be
thrown in jail at some point during its life.

408
00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:50.126
You know what?
Let me give you my statistical analysis.

409
00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:52.806
You going to San Quentin.
There's 100 percent chance...

410
00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:55.691
that you're gonna be somebody's bitch.
Ten years of this:

411
00:25:58.520 --> 00:25:59.681
- You know what that is?
- Mm-mm.

412
00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:01.683
A big-ass black man
on your pale white ass.

413
00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:08.083
"No! I don't want any more!
Stop! That's enough."

414
00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:11.011
Too late. He done tagged the next guy in.

415
00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:13.882
That's like a rabbit.
You don't want him no more...

416
00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:16.407
so now here comes the guy
that wants to rub your face.

417
00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:18.722
"I like his hair." He's breathing on you.

418
00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:22.123
That's disgusting. But guess what?
You can look forward to 10 years of it!

419
00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:24.760
What if I speak to all the bitches
and we organize...

420
00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:27.730
form a union, and we put our feet down
and say, "Enough!"

421
00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:30.247
- There's gotta be more of us than them.
- There's not.

422
00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:34.161
You deserve everything you're getting.
Good luck on survival, sir.

423
00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:36.806
Better luck on handling yourself!

424
00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:40.522
Wait! Wait! Wait! Don't leave.
Don't leave, please. I could use your help.

425
00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:41.727
Help you with what?

426
00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:45.361
Help me to not be someone's bitch.

427
00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:50.047
You expect me to help you?
I'm supposed to teach you what?

428
00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:51.406
How to prevent this:

429
00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:55.965
- All right, stop.
- You could train me.

430
00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:59.044
You could be the Athena to my Odysseus.

431
00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.328
I don't even know
what the fuck that is, man!

432
00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:03.320
I could pay you.

433
00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:05.365
Whatever it takes.

434
00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:07.130
I need $30,000.

435
00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:09.409
Done.
_Qh__.

436
00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:10.840
Okay.

437
00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:12.965
Yup. Yeah.

438
00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:15.481
- Fantastic.
- All right.

439
00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:18.080
What are you doing?

440
00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:19.645
I only know these two.

441
00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:21.770
What are you trying to do?

442
00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:24.810
- Shake? You wanna shake my hand?
- Oh, regular.

443
00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:26.962
- It's a deal. We got a deal.
- Excellent.

444
00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:29.811
- Thank you, Darnell.
<i>- I'll</i> see you in the morning, convict.

445
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.490
What are you doing? What is that?

446
00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:33.005
- Trying to do this thing.
- No.

447
00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:34.969
- Shake. It's fine.
- Okay.

448
00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:37.248
Mr. King, no. I got that.

449
00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:39.642
- All right. No problem.
- I appreciate it.

450
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.001
I appreciate it.

451
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.411
Oh.

452
00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:50.287
Yes! Thank you!

453
00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:52.050
Thank you, Jesus!

454
00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:55.647
I knew it! I knew my day would come.

455
00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:57.484
I'm getting the house.

456
00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:01.361
I'm getting the house. Unh!

457
00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:07.769
Babe. This does not make any sense.

458
00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:09.445
Why would he hire you?

459
00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:12.968
- Because he thinks I went to prison, babe.
- That's the part I don't get.

460
00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:15.771
- Why would you tell him that?
- I didn't. He assumed that.

461
00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:16.961
- He assumed it?
- Yes!

462
00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:20.124
So what reason did you give him
to assume that you went to jail?

463
00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:21.441
I was being black.

464
00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:26.284
- This is nuts.
- Okay. I don't get what's nuts to you.

465
00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:30.126
In 30 days, we'll have the money, the house
will be ours. What is the problem?

466
00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:34.080
The problem is he is never going to believe
that you went to jail.

467
00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:37.682
Look, babe. I am your wife,
so I will put it to you straight.

468
00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:40.003
You are not exactly a thug.

469
00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:42.931
I don't have to be a thug to portray a thug.
Okay?

470
00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:47.651
Honestly, all I gotta do is change my voice,
talk a little deeper.

471
00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:51.122
Talk like this and be
every stereotype he already thinks I am.

472
00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:53.851
Right now, I'm thugging.
This is thugging.

473
00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:56.486
You're so good at it, sweetie.

474
00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:58.650
Have a good night.

475
00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:02.883
- Bitch! Don't walk away from me!
- What the hell did you just say to me?

476
00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:05.441
- Girl, stop. Stop!
- What is wrong with you?

477
00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:09.002
What is that?
I love you! I was playing!

478
00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:13.168
- Bitch.
- What?

479
00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:15.129
- I didn't say nothing!
- Oh.

480
00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:17.123
Man, I didn't say nothing.

481
00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:19.444
You wanna watch The <i>Notebook?</i>

482
00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:22.685
- I love you and Makayla.
- Yeah, I love you too. Good night.

483
00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:29.047
You've reached the mailbox of Martin Clark.

484
00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:31.208
<i>Please leave a message after the tone.</i>

485
00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:32.851
Hi, Dad?

486
00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:34.690
It's James.

487
00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:38.208
Just wondering if there's any word
from the investigators.

488
00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:40.045
I still love you.

489
00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:43.530
Thank you. Bye.

490
00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:47.886
<i>Now, I heard a crazy story about you.
This guy James King?</i>

491
00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:52.682
<i>And I heard that you played at the party
where he got arrested.</i>

492
00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:56.049
<i>Yeah. I had no idea
that I was performing for a monster.</i>

493
00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:59.568
<i>I don't know how to explain what it's like
to take money from someone like that.</i>

494
00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:01.563
<i>It makes you wanna give it back to them...</i>

495
00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:04.405
<i>except that would be worse
because then they'd have it.</i>

496
00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:09.569
<i>And it's that whole helpless feeling that I have
about our creative process being monetized...</i>

497
00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:12.610
<i>and that's what inspired me
to write this song...</i>

498
00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:15.286
<i>which is actually available
on iTunes tonight at midnight.</i>

499
00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:17.608
<i>- If I can play it.
- Great.</i>

500
00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:21.490
<i>I can't see through walls.</i>

501
00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:25.131
<i>And I can't read your mind.</i>

502
00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:28.961
<i>But if I did I'd find.</i>

503
00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:32.886
<i>That man James King is a great big turd.</i>

504
00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:36.803
<i>I mean the small, small kinds.</i>

505
00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:39.488
<i>But that **** James.</i>

506
00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:42.531
<i>Will fall
Hands against the prison wall.</i>

507
00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:45.604
<i>Choking on a mouthful of balls.</i>

508
00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:48.241
<i>He'll be choking on
A mouthful of balls</i>

509
00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:50.323
I hate to admit it, but it's a good song.

510
00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:53.324
<i>FALLON".
Okay, very nice. John Mayer, everybody.</i>

511
00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:56.165
Now I'm gonna be dreaming about balls.

512
00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:58.805
Hey, Russell.

513
00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.809
It's Darnell.

514
00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:03.442
Your cousin. Your cousin, Darnell, man.

515
00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:04.761
Hey, listen, Russell...

516
00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:08.487
how would you like to make $500
just for telling me what prison was like.

517
00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:13.727
Well, I don't wanna say that.
Russell, I shouldn't have to say that.

518
00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:15.970
For what?! What is...?

519
00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:17.451
Fine. Fine.

520
00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:20.211
I'm a Cliff Huxtable pussy-looking
motherfucker.

521
00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:23.651
No! I'm not even wearing khakis.

522
00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:29.722
Russell, can you please just help me, what I'm
asking you for? Just start from the beginning.

523
00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:34.010
No, no. Like, the beginning, the beginning.
Like, the first day of prison.

524
00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:37.251
On the first day?

525
00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:40.046
Oh. There's no warm-up?

526
00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:41.887
That's sad.

527
00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:44.648
Russell, I'm sorry,
did I just hear a gunshot?

528
00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:47.167
You gotta go. Okay. Bye.

529
00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:57.887
Ready, mother...?

530
00:31:58.040 --> 00:31:59.565
Ready, mother...? Ready, mother...?

531
00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:02.326
That's it, that's it. Ahem.

532
00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.411
Coming!

533
00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:11.361
Rita, Makayla, new house, good school.

534
00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:12.681
You ready, motherfucker?

535
00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:14.524
Just a second!

536
00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:21.730
Hello?

537
00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:23.723
- You ready, motherfucker?!
- Aah!

538
00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:27.246
- Oh, it burns!
- Pepper spray, bitch!

539
00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:30.887
You always be on guard, okay?

540
00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:33.520
On the inside, there's somebody
on every corner to fuck you up!

541
00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:36.929
Prison school is in session, bitch!
You already failing.

542
00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:42.483
I'm so glad I hired you.
This is just what I need.

543
00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:44.927
Okay. What's next?

544
00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:47.560
What the...?!
How many motherfuckers live here?!

545
00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:50.690
All right. Let's get started.

546
00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:53.487
This right here is
my prison readiness program.

547
00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:57.531
If you follow this guide and do exactly
what I say you will survive in prison.

548
00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:00.406
"Keistering."

549
00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:04.804
- What's keistering?
- Slow down! You ain't ready for that.

550
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.081
You're the teacher.

551
00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:10.962
And I just want you to know I'll do whatever
it takes to survive and get my life back.

552
00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:12.963
That's good,
because let me tell you something:

553
00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:15.487
You're gonna have to work harder
than you ever worked before.

554
00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:20.641
Back when I was in Harvard Business School,
I was facing some pretty long odds.

555
00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:23.041
But I buckled down and I succeeded.

556
00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:25.851
When you was at Harvard,
did you ever get raped for failing a test?

557
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.809
I think that's more of a Yale thing.

558
00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:36.371
-"Yale."
- I'm sorry.

559
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.764
Shut the fuck up!

560
00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:44.000
Now from this point on,
this ain't your house no more.

561
00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:47.369
- This San Quentin! You understand me?
- Okay.

562
00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:49.529
From now on this will be your cell.

563
00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:52.485
You do not leave this room
without my permission.

564
00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:55.485
It's good.

565
00:33:57.160 --> 00:34:00.004
- For you to sleep on, sefior.
- Go on, we ain't got time for games.

566
00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:01.810
Go upstairs,
turn this place into prison.

567
00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:05.442
It will be our pleasure to repay you
for your many kindnesses.

568
00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:11.011
Put that in there in front of the statues
with the dicks.

569
00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:12.811
James, listen to me.

570
00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:16.169
The key to survival in prison lies
in the following simple questions:

571
00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:18.442
Are you hard?
And can you handle yourself?

572
00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:23.243
Well, this is a rare moment for optimism
because the answer to that is a resounding yes.

573
00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:26.165
That's good. Let me see
what your mad-dog face look like.

574
00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:28.841
- I'm sorry. What's a mad dog?
- You a mad dog!

575
00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:30.963
- Oh, shit.
- What's your what, nigga?

576
00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:33.361
- Take whatever you want!
- Let me see that!

577
00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:35.045
No!

578
00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:39.005
- Stop! I beg of you!
- Like a pit bull with no leash.

579
00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:44.045
That's a mad dog.

580
00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:46.362
Wow. I knew you were the right guy
for the job.

581
00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:50.884
In prison, a mad-dog face is essential to
your survival. Do you understand me, James?

582
00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:55.682
So the idea is that I make a face that conveys
the fact that I'd have no problem hurting you.

583
00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:58.731
Exactly what it is.
Now, convey that shit. Let me see it.

584
00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:01.486
Okay. Ahem.

585
00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:04.124
Ha!

586
00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:06.644
- That's terrible.
- Ha, ha.

587
00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:09.690
No, that's horrible, man. Anger.
You gotta show me anger.

588
00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:13.242
- Why you smiling?
- I'm not smiling. I'm tense and I'm agitated.

589
00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:14.765
Come on, man!

590
00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:16.889
- Unh!
- That's your mad... That's it?!

591
00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:19.441
- Your fiancée left you.
- That's right!

592
00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:21.409
- You happy about that?
- No.

593
00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:24.086
Then get mad! She gonna leave you?
What is she doing?

594
00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:27.926
She probably on her knees sucking
somebody dick in the back seat of a truck.

595
00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:29.847
Show...

596
00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:31.967
James.

597
00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:35.524
Oh. Oh. Come on. Come on.

598
00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:38.803
- I miss her so much.
- What the fuck are you doing, James?

599
00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:40.771
I'm sad-dogging YOU-

600
00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:46.210
- James?
- You think that's a strategy that could work?

601
00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:48.931
No. I don't think it's a strategy
that could work.

602
00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:51.771
Hey, listen up, everyone. I'm extremely sad.

603
00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:55.325
Please don't sexually assault me.
I'm already too sad.

604
00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:58.245
Hey, fellas. My heart's already been raped.

605
00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:00.721
I don't wanna do this anymore.
Let's move on. Okay?

606
00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:04.043
We're moving on from the mad dog.
James, can you fight?

607
00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:06.491
Absolutely.

608
00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:10.561
What?

609
00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:12.762
You had to change your clothes for this?

610
00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:16.969
What the fuck are you doing, man?

611
00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:19.168
It's called capoeira.

612
00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:20.890
It's a Brazilian martial art.

613
00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:23.361
But don't be fooled
by its beauty and grace.

614
00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:26.006
It's actually quite deadly.

615
00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:27.645
This is deadly?

616
00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:30.080
That's deadly?

617
00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:31.527
- Stab.
- Ow.

618
00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:33.006
- Stab.
- Stop.

619
00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:35.640
- Stab. Stab.
- Guards! Guards!

620
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.162
- Stabbity-stab, stab, stab!
- Ow. Ow!

621
00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:40.322
The fuck are you doing, man?

622
00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:42.847
Shit ain't gonna save you in San Quentin!

623
00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.890
Well, that may not,
but you haven't seen my Béngéo kick.

624
00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:48.168
- Your what?!
- My Béngéo kick.

625
00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:56.524
Look what your dumb ass done did. Stab.

626
00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:59.890
- Stab.
- I'm dead.

627
00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:02.008
Stab, stab, stab, stab.

628
00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:06.090
You're so bad.

629
00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:11.128
James. I gotta tell ya. I just can't imagine
what you must be going through.

630
00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:13.682
It is so nice to talk to you.

631
00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:17.926
<i>- What's the latest from the investigators?
- The investigators?</i>

632
00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:21.046
- Chinese hackers. They're pretty sure.
- Hey!

633
00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:24.609
I know I'm not crazy. Didn't I tell you
to get off the phone? Get off the phone.

634
00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:27.724
- Hey, who are you talking to?
- It's Darnell. He's helping me.

635
00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:29.086
Your time is up!

636
00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:31.288
- I gotta go. I'll call you back.
- Hang it up!

637
00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:33.204
- If I get more phone time.
- Hang it up!

638
00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:34.725
That was important to me!

639
00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:37.201
When you got a line of inmates
waiting to use the phone...

640
00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:39.767
you do not wanna piss them off, James.

641
00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:41.889
I'm going to fuck you up, Mr. James!

642
00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:43.201
Rosa!

643
00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:45.244
You watch your back on the yard.

644
00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:50.728
<i>I'm not a puto.</i>

645
00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:53.480
Great.

646
00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:56.968
- All right. We got a problem.
- What's that?

647
00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:58.929
James is talking to somebody.

648
00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:00.241
No, no, he trusts you.

649
00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:03.165
- He'll never put two and two together.
- No, stop it!

650
00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:04.924
- This is your fault!
- What?

651
00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:07.321
Well, you couldn't get him
to take the plea deal.

652
00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:12.407
Instead of him going to prison, you got him
3O days to be out there, running around...

653
00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:13.601
fucking things up!

654
00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:18.163
I had to make it look good. You throw a fight,
you don't go down in the first round. It's fine.

655
00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:22.121
I don't want him out there,
playing detective with somebody.

656
00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:25.686
You keep an eye on my
ex-future son-in-law, would ya?

657
00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:29.202
- And find out who this Darnell is.
- I'm on it. Right away.

658
00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:30.925
There you go.

659
00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:37.282
All right, James. Look, you're gonna
get in a fight on the inside. Okay?

660
00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:40.091
You don't need to win,
but you need to show these guys...

661
00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:44.802
that you're not afraid to fight back. Get used
to fighting. See those guys over there?

662
00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:49.843
- Yes.
- Go over there and fight one of them.

663
00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:52.970
That's insane!

664
00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:56.566
They're behemoths.
They would break my spine.

665
00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:59.371
Those are the type of guys
you're gonna see in San Quentin.

666
00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:04.122
So you gotta shake that fear. I want you to go
and punch that big-ass dude in the mouth.

667
00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:07.329
Oh, my God. My heart is pounding.

668
00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:10.445
Okay.

669
00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:22.685
Hey, guys.

670
00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:25.005
Who the fuck are you, man?

671
00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:29.644
I wanna fight you.

672
00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:31.367
What?

673
00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:35.491
You picked the wrong day
to come to the park.

674
00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:40.688
- Is this some kind of joke, man?
- You ever been mad-dogged before?

675
00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:44.527
You about to get some right now,
motherfucker.

676
00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:47.768
What the fuck is that, man?

677
00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:49.729
It's the size of your dick.

678
00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:52.601
I'm gonna break it off, make you eat it.

679
00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:58.766
You fuck your mother with that dick?

680
00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:00.883
How do you know my mama?!
You don't know my mama.

681
00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:02.806
Oh, no.

682
00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:06.045
- Aah! Aah! Aah!
- Come on! Get him! Get him!

683
00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:07.691
Get back here, bitch!

684
00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:11.726
Oh, no! Please don't hurt my body! Aah!

685
00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:13.689
No! My body!

686
00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:16.486
Help me!

687
00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:18.722
You're breaking my spine!

688
00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:32.365
What happened to my tennis court?

689
00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:37.208
You will no longer refer to this area as a tennis
court. From this point on, this is the yard.

690
00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:41.001
Understand something, James.
The yard is the most deadliest part of prison.

691
00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:45.206
It's where you get your few precious minutes
of fresh air and sunlight. Understand?

692
00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:46.964
Fresh air.

693
00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:51.529
How many times did I breathe in clean air,
fragrant with lavender, and take it for granted?

694
00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:54.684
James, I don't give a fuck how many times.
I don't give a shit.

695
00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:56.729
- I'm just saying.
- Shut up, James.

696
00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:59.804
You gotta step carefully because if you step
in the wrong place...

697
00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:03.169
you'll end up in the wrong territory.
For a person like you that can't fight...

698
00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:06.290
it's not a good thing, James.
It's not a good thing at all.

699
00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:10.047
Right now, you in the brothers-only section.
You got two seconds to get out.

700
00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:12.282
- Before you get mollywhopped.
- Okay, Darnell.

701
00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:13.646
- Who's Darnell?!
- You are.

702
00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:14.961
My name is Leroy!

703
00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:18.283
- Yeah, I suggest you walk, white boy. Walk!
- All right. I'm walking.

704
00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:20.249
- Turn around and walk!
- I'm walking.

705
00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:22.651
- Hey, ése.
- What?

706
00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:25.565
- You got a problem, gringo?
- Darnell, what are you doing?

707
00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:29.167
Darnell? Who's Darnell, ése?
You're looking at Carlos.

708
00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:32.244
I suggest you walk wherever you came
from, ése, before you have a problem.

709
00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:34.607
- I was trying to leave that area.
- You need to go back...

710
00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:36.928
over there with the negros, ése.
With Leroy?

711
00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:39.970
You go back over there with the negros!
That's where you belong.

712
00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:42.202
- I don't see anyone.
- You belong with the Negros.

713
00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:43.521
- Go.
- I'm going.

714
00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:46.160
- Fuck you calling a negro?!
- He was. I wasn't.

715
00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:49.051
I told you, Carlos!
Keep that shit over there on your side!

716
00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:51.328
- Take the Yankee with you!
<i>- I'll</i> go with you!

717
00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:53.403
Hey, I don't want him.

718
00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:55.244
He's a negro lover. You take him.

719
00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:57.801
Motherfucker! Say something else, bro!

720
00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:01.282
Hey! Hey, I swear to God.
I swear to God, I'll cut you, ése.

721
00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:04.171
- Let's just shake hands.
- There is no shaking hands, gringo.

722
00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:05.810
- Friendship.
- Go back where you belong.

723
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.240
I don't know where I belong.

724
00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:10.165
Leave him alone. I'll keep him.

725
00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:12.484
You belong with me.

726
00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.650
- Who are you?
- I'm Dante.

727
00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:18.089
Why don't you leave him alone, Carlos!
Leave him alone, Leroy!

728
00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:20.527
- Are you a woman?
- I am if you want me to be.

729
00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:21.967
I don't want that.

730
00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:24.561
- Okay, I know what you are.
- Let me hold your pocket.

731
00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:26.688
- Let me hold your pocket.
- All right.

732
00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:30.163
I claimed him! He mine, Leroy!

733
00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:33.722
Bitch, you got two seconds
to let his fucking pocket go. Two!

734
00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:36.167
- Motherfucker! You got two seconds!
- Don't hit a woman!

735
00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:38.124
- Gonna knock your ass out!
- Don't hit a woman!

736
00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:39.606
You don't want my pocket.

737
00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:42.331
You don't want it. So what?
Why can't I be happy?

738
00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:47.330
Hey, ése. I don't like you
and this domestic shit in front of my crew.

739
00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:48.527
You think I like it?

740
00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:51.160
You need to fucking take it
somewhere else, ése, huh?

741
00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:53.322
Gringo, you take you
and your dirty bitch elsewhere.

742
00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:56.086
<i>- I'll</i> go over there.
- Don't call me dirty.

743
00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:59.130
I wasn't dirty when you was up in it.
I wasn't dirty then, was I?

744
00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:02.008
You were dirty then. You're dirty now.

745
00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:05.364
- He ain't complaining.
- You should get tested.

746
00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:09.361
No, I'm not complaining because
we have yet to have any sort of interaction.

747
00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:11.688
- Tonight will be our night.
- No. Tonight won't happen.

748
00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:13.968
- Be my white knight. Save me.
- Don't get your hopes up.

749
00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:16.168
Let me ride you.
Let me ride you into safety.

750
00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:20.729
No! I don't feel comfortable with that.
Let go of me! Leroy is going to be upset.

751
00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:23.806
- I knew you were coming back.
- Motherfucker!

752
00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:25.405
I knew you were coming back.

753
00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:27.483
You making me mad, motherfucker!

754
00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:30.246
- I'm not doing anything!
- I'm about to whoop your ass, white boy!

755
00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:33.570
- I'm just standing here.
- No, you not. You got my bitch!

756
00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:35.848
- Trying to figure out a place...
- I'm your old bitch.

757
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.047
We're like zebras.

758
00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:39.965
- We're not like a zebra.
- We are like a zebra. You're my...

759
00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:44.205
Somehow you're getting me to hug you,
and I don't know how that's happening.

760
00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:49.042
That's it! That's it, gringo.
I swear, I'm getting sick of this shit. I'll stab you.

761
00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:52.687
I'm still confused as to what piece
you are in this puzzle, Carlos.

762
00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.651
Hold on! Hold on. Question, question.

763
00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:57.325
Are there any French gangs?

764
00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:00.522
I speak French. I'm not fluent, but I can...

765
00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:06.888
Can I join the gang, <i>s'il</i> vous pla/"t?

766
00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:10.490
You know what?
You can't fight. Since you can't fight...

767
00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:13.962
I'm left with one choice,
and that's to get your stupid ass in shape.

768
00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:16.248
God! You're failing.

769
00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:19.880
I've got a state-of-the-art gym
4O feet away.

770
00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:21.644
Ain't no gyms in San Quentin.

771
00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:25.202
Curl me, bitch! Curl me!

772
00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:28.451
Maybe I should start with a baby
at higher reps.

773
00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:31.848
Hey! Hey, you!

774
00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:34.802
- I wanna fight you.
- What'd you say, dickhead?

775
00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:37.489
I wanna fight you, asshole.

776
00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:40.569
Let's just rest here.

777
00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:46.889
Look at his face. He looks like
he's getting fucked right now.

778
00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:49.810
Come on!

779
00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:52.247
You better not drop me! Goddamn it!

780
00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:55.486
Excuse me, sir. I hate to bother you,
but I need to fight you.

781
00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:56.801
I was in Nam!

782
00:44:57.360 --> 00:44:59.362
And I fucking loved it!

783
00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:02.289
James, you gotta throw something back!

784
00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:04.161
Darnell!

785
00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:05.760
Oh.

786
00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:07.086
Save me!

787
00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:11.448
<i>Attention inmates, lockdown in five minutes.</i>

788
00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:13.961
<i>And don't try any stupid shit.</i>

789
00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:29.003
What did they do to my yard?

790
00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:31.925
No prison can hold James King.

791
00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:42.168
- We got a runner. Mr. James is running!
- Oh, fuck me!

792
00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:45.967
You're in my world now, bitch!

793
00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:53.081
Mother... Shit!

794
00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:55.720
You're never getting out alive! Ha, ha.

795
00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:57.885
Fuck a bag of tits!

796
00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:00.560
Release the dogs!

797
00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:02.449
What? Dogs?

798
00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:10.488
There's nowhere to run, Mr. James.

799
00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:14.161
You don't know when to quit, Mr. James.

800
00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:31.087
You couldn't get past Cecelio
and some Chihuahuas.

801
00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:35.131
Tell me how you gonna escape San Quentin.
Stop wasting my time, James.

802
00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:40.480
That's what happens
when you try to jump a fence illegally. Hm?

803
00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:51.209
Your training's not going well, man.

804
00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:54.125
Frankly, I don't feel like
you're giving me 100 percent.

805
00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:57.170
And as your incarceration expert,
that concerns me.

806
00:46:57.360 --> 00:46:59.408
Because it's my job to prepare you.

807
00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:02.090
Fortunately, I got a plan.

808
00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:04.447
Oh, thank God. Oh, that's good.

809
00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:08.170
- You're gonna learn how to suck dick.
- What?!

810
00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:10.891
Oh, God.

811
00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:13.886
Listen up.
I said I want you to learn how to suck dick.

812
00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:15.565
I heard you!

813
00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:17.891
- That's your plan?
- Yes.

814
00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:21.726
All I'm saying is that when life puts a dick
in your mouth, you make dickade.

815
00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:25.202
"Dickade" doesn't sound like
a significant improvement over dick.

816
00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:28.006
Bottom line, James!
I know what I'm talking about.

817
00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:30.401
- We're talking about survival.
- I understand.

818
00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:35.362
- Because that's how you survived. Right?
- No, you shut your mouth. No, it is not.

819
00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:36.846
I survived with these.

820
00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:41.042
- Dual hand jobs.
- No. No! I kill with these.

821
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:46.289
That's the difference between me and you.
Hence, why you need to suck a dick.

822
00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:47.647
Come on, man.

823
00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:51.081
Where am I gonna find someone who...?

824
00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:52.844
We're at the lvars Brasserie.

825
00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:54.240
Look around you.

826
00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:56.448
This is L.A.'s number-one
gay hookup scene.

827
00:47:56.640 --> 00:48:01.806
- Voted "Flirtiest Brunch" three years in a row.
- What do I say? What do I literally say?

828
00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:05.123
You say, "I wanna suck your dick." Politely.

829
00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:09.524
Hey, hi. I'm James.
You mind if I could give you a little head?

830
00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:11.569
- Hey, I'm James.
- I wanna suck your dick.

831
00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:13.927
- I wanna suck your dick.
- There you go! Just dive in!

832
00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:16.003
- That's what they do.
- What if someone says no?

833
00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:18.601
He ain't gonna say no. It's a scientific fact.

834
00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:19.841
According to who?

835
00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:22.122
Dickapedia! Why do you care?

836
00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:25.966
- Is that a real site?
- No. James, it's a... Get up.

837
00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:29.442
You're gonna go to that bar.
That guy. That guy right there.

838
00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:33.446
Get up, go over there, and politely ask
that man can you suck his dick.

839
00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:36.451
Oh, my gosh.
I can't believe I'm about to do this.

840
00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:38.045
Survival.

841
00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:40.125
Go survive.

842
00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:43.121
All right. I'll just go do it.

843
00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:44.805
Yes, go do it.

844
00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:50.007
Okay.

845
00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:52.128
Come on. Are we doing this or not, okay?

846
00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:53.970
Yes, we're definitely doing it.

847
00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:57.640
Hey, I was nervous the first time
I did karaoke, right?

848
00:48:58.320 --> 00:48:59.685
Just get up there and sing.

849
00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:02.403
This is terrible foreplay. Come on.

850
00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:04.210
- I'm gonna put it in my mouth.
- Yeah.

851
00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:07.330
I'm gonna suck your di...
Your di...

852
00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:08.970
I'm gonna suck your di...

853
00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:10.406
That's what we're here for.

854
00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:13.848
I'll gonna put your di... in my mouth.
I'm gonna give you he...

855
00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:15.166
Facial.

856
00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:17.927
Down the hatch! Heh.

857
00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:24.841
Eating alone?

858
00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:28.162
I just thought you could use
some company.

859
00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:30.249
Oh... Oh.

860
00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:31.726
Okay, I see what this is.

861
00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:35.001
You think that you can get with me?

862
00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:40.366
- Interesting topic of conversation.
- Wait. No. That wasn't a sit-down invitation.

863
00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:44.729
- You're like a 6.
- Thank you.

864
00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:49.285
No, it's not a compliment.
That's not a good number. I'm like a 9.

865
00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:51.808
If I were to get into this game...

866
00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:54.291
- You know, the gay game...
- Uh-huh.

867
00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:57.086
By the way,
the gay game is a game you can win.

868
00:49:57.240 --> 00:50:00.881
No, it's not, because I don't wanna play.
I'm saying "if."

869
00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:03.566
There's a spot on the bench for you,
if you decide to join.

870
00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:05.609
No, I'm not on the bench, man.

871
00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:07.364
Okay, starter! Heh.

872
00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:08.766
I'm not gay, man.

873
00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:12.925
I'm here, supporting a friend,
doing some gay stuff.

874
00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:16.926
I'm sorry. My name is Chris. It's short
for Christmas Came Early This Year.

875
00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:23.084
Where are you at, man?

876
00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:24.721
Come on, man.

877
00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:26.882
This is gonna help me in the long run.

878
00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:29.924
- Here. Right there.
- Don't point it at me.

879
00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:32.928
Hey! Have fun with it, right?

880
00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:34.570
- Have fun with it.
- Yeah.

881
00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:37.371
- Come on.
- Three, two, one! In the mouth!

882
00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:53.808
Look, you're gonna
find you someone, man.

883
00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:57.043
You just gotta set your sights on something
more realistic, you know?

884
00:50:57.280 --> 00:51:00.011
You gotta think long-term.
Think about the relationship.

885
00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:02.681
Who are you gonna raise
that Chinese baby with?

886
00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:04.683
- I don't know.
- Hm?

887
00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:08.128
Who are you gonna restore
that Airstream camper with?

888
00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:12.046
Who are you gonna drive and open
that bed-and-breakfast in New Hampshire with?

889
00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:14.925
- This is what I need to hear.
- Yes! Yes.

890
00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:19.881
I can't do it. I really tried. I just can't!
You have to train me.

891
00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:21.247
It's my last chance.

892
00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:23.402
You ready to train harder
than you've ever trained?

893
00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:26.007
Because once we go,
we do not hold back.

894
00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:27.685
We do it! And we do it hard!

895
00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:29.080
Are you ready to get hard?

896
00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:30.890
I am ready. I'm ready to get hard!

897
00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:33.247
- You're gonna show me you can get hard!
- I'm gonna show you!

898
00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:35.727
I'm gonna get so hard!
Because I'm gonna show you how hard!

899
00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:38.850
That's what I wanna hear.
Then let's go home and get hard.

900
00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:50.202
I want what they have.

901
00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:53.045
Yeah!

902
00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:54.690
Yeah, James!

903
00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:55.927
Yeah!

904
00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:01.410
- Unh!
- Yeah!

905
00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:02.971
That's what I'm talking about!

906
00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:05.043
- Ugh.
- Sho'enough!

907
00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:08.251
Fear of dick-sucking
will give a man strength.

908
00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:14.085
Fuck you.

909
00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:15.969
Fuck cock!

910
00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:17.561
Shit!

911
00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:22.681
Hey, back off! You better get those tits
out of my face! Or I'll show you my tits!

912
00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:25.491
- What are you doing?
- Working on my trash talk.

913
00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:27.682
You know, to get respect
from the other inmates.

914
00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:29.445
Let me hear some of it.

915
00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:32.488
All right. Ahem.

916
00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:36.404
Hey, pal. I'm about to tear you a new ass.

917
00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:39.801
You gonna have to do a little better
than that, James.

918
00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:42.448
Hey, I'm about to tear you a new ass.

919
00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:44.602
And sew up your old ass!

920
00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:46.685
Okay. All right.

921
00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:48.842
I'm gonna punch you in the fuck!

922
00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.082
I'm gonna make you my bitch's bitch!

923
00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:53.641
You're gonna be my grand-bitch!

924
00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:57.208
Yeah. You're about to 20 likes
on lnstafuck.

925
00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:01.084
If I see you around here again,
I'm gonna put a hashtag on your ass.

926
00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:03.408
And see how many hits it gets.

927
00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:05.484
- Hmm?
- Oh, my God.

928
00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:08.928
Hope you brought your Costco card,
because you're about to get dick in bulk!

929
00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:11.089
What? This is so dark.

930
00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:14.210
How does a prix fixe dinner
of five courses of dick sound?

931
00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:16.328
- You eat organic?
- What?

932
00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:20.451
How about fresh farm-to-table,
a purée of my balls!

933
00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:25.128
Yeah. Merry Dickmas, Santa Cock!
Hmm?

934
00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:26.771
Okay. All right, man.

935
00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:28.490
Where is this stuff coming from, James?

936
00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:31.849
Hey, son.
You're a disappointment to your parents.

937
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.411
Who I fucked!

938
00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:34.840
Oh, shit.

939
00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.765
James, this is sick.
You gotta be crazy to think of this.

940
00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:39.770
That crazy is good.

941
00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:42.605
Thank you. I've got about six hours more.

942
00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:45.081
That's good, James. That's really good.

943
00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:48.601
I like that. I like that a lot.

944
00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:53.325
I hope you brought your dick punch-card
because the eighth dick is free.

945
00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:54.720
Stab!

946
00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:57.169
Shit! Okay.

947
00:53:57.800 --> 00:53:59.131
That's not bad, James.

948
00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:01.609
That's not bad at all.

949
00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:03.281
Progress.

950
00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:13.681
Peter piper picked a peck
of pickled cocks!

951
00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:16.966
Yes.

952
00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:26.368
Hey, hey, hey!
You ready to get to work today?

953
00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:29.645
Huh?

954
00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:32.371
- Hello.
- What's all this stuff?

955
00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:34.130
Oh, these are shanks.

956
00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:35.725
Or "shivs."

957
00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:38.969
In Scotland, they're referred to as "chibs."

958
00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:43.170
In fact, I made this one for you.

959
00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:46.284
- Really?
- Yeah.

960
00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:49.531
Just to say thank you
for all the hard work.

961
00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:51.167
Oh, man.

962
00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:54.445
That's nice. That's cool.

963
00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:59.328
Whoa, whoa. Don't hold it by the blade.
Haven't you ever held one before? Right here.

964
00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:02.730
Yeah, no, my cellie
used to hold them all the time.

965
00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:04.962
I don't like them.
They cause too much trouble.

966
00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:07.771
You pull that out on the yard, somebody
come out attack you, they can do this to you.

967
00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:09.968
Now what do you do?
You know what I mean?

968
00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:14.808
What the hell? Where'd that come from?

969
00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:16.291
I taught myself how to keister.

970
00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:20.284
How to keister? Up the keister?

971
00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:23.444
Look, the electronic toothbrush part,
it still works.

972
00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:26.171
Oh, no. Okay, James. Cut it off.

973
00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:28.324
Cut it off. Get it out of my face, man.

974
00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:29.925
I can turn it on with no hands.

975
00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:32.367
I don't want to see that.
I don't want to see that trick.

976
00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:34.363
It's okay. Put it back. God.

977
00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:36.249
- Put it back?
- No. No, no.

978
00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:38.323
Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Please.

979
00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:41.091
- Do you want me to teach you how?
- No, I'm gonna pass on that.

980
00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:43.129
It starts with a simple inverse inhale.

981
00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:46.367
James, stop it.

982
00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:49.126
That, with a simultaneous
relaxing of the sphincter.

983
00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:51.005
I don't wanna know.

984
00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:52.406
You sure?

985
00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:55.609
I'm positive.
I just wanna ask you one question.

986
00:55:55.760 --> 00:55:59.606
I was over there,
and I was touching all those shanks.

987
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:01.411
Were they, uh...?

988
00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:05.721
- Keistered?
- Yeah. Were they keistered?

989
00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:09.522
Most of them. Yeah.

990
00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:21.330
We're about to simulate a prison riot.

991
00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:23.966
Understand that this is
the most dangerous situation there is.

992
00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:26.202
Prisoners are scared.
Guards are scared.

993
00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:29.165
The key to surviving is to not freak out.

994
00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:33.251
- Good Lord. What's gonna happen?
- Cecelio's just gonna throw some stuff at you.

995
00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:35.846
Some roosters, some mangly
homeless guys, whatever he's got.

996
00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:38.970
- He's really excited about this.
- Okay. Let's do it.

997
00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:40.605
Wait, don't I get body armor?

998
00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:43.081
No. We don't have that type of time.
Cecelio!

999
00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:44.765
Why don't we have enough time?

1000
00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:47.088
Remember, do not freak out.

1001
00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:48.366
Lights!

1002
00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:49.567
Music!

1003
00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:50.801
Who wants to party?!

1004
00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:54.364
Go! Go! Go!

1005
00:56:54.520 --> 00:56:56.522
Cecelio! Release the chickens!

1006
00:56:56.720 --> 00:56:58.722
No, no, no, James! Don't freak out!

1007
00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:00.450
Darnell, there's a baboon!

1008
00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:03.244
- You're in my world now!
- Aah!

1009
00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:05.606
Someone let me out!

1010
00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:07.091
Stop freaking out!

1011
00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:11.288
It's fucking beautiful!

1012
00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:15.806
Oh, shit!

1013
00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:18.049
Die! Die!

1014
00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:23.485
Cecelio, turn it off!

1015
00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:25.290
Turn it off!

1016
00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:26.966
Turn it off!

1017
00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:28.645
James, I've lost control!

1018
00:57:28.840 --> 00:57:32.526
Cecelia! Pull back! I have lost control!

1019
00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:35.170
Oh, my God!

1020
00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:36.685
- God!
- Oh, my God.

1021
00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:38.001
Shit!

1022
00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:39.491
- I'm stabbed!
- No!

1023
00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:41.569
- I'm cut!
- No, you cut me, man!

1024
00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:42.926
You stabbed me!

1025
00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:44.161
- No, I didn't!
- Yes, you did!

1026
00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:48.120
I told you, don't freak out!
You freaked out! God! Wait...

1027
00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:49.691
- No, I'm okay.
- Hold up.

1028
00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:51.604
It's just the wine.

1029
00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:53.046
I see all the wine, man.

1030
00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:54.326
I totally feel fine.

1031
00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:56.724
- Oh, fuck!
- What? It's a...

1032
00:57:58.200 --> 00:57:59.326
Oh.

1033
00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:03.246
- Oh, that's where the other one went.
- Okay, just sit down.

1034
00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:05.482
- It's a shiv. It's just a shiv.
- Yes, I know.

1035
00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:06.880
Hey, don't freak out.

1036
00:58:07.080 --> 00:58:08.127
- I'm gonna pull it.
- Okay.

1037
00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:15.206
Oh, my God.

1038
00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:18.011
It's like a fishhook. The more you pull,
the deeper it lodges.

1039
00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:21.607
All right. Okay. Look, my wife's a nurse.
Let's get you to my wife. Okay?

1040
00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:23.808
God. Oh, God.

1041
00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:25.803
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1042
00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:28.289
It's sticking right out of my head.

1043
00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:31.962
James, listen. I don't want to look at it
no more because I'm starting to...

1044
00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:33.565
Oh, shit. I'm so scared.

1045
00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:35.961
I know. Can you fucking
just keep your head...

1046
00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:37.731
Ow!

1047
00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:40.925
- Oh, God!
- You drove it in a little deeper.

1048
00:58:41.120 --> 00:58:44.522
Oh, God. Oh, James, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1049
00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:46.489
- Is my eye twitching?
- No!

1050
00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:49.325
- Answer the question. Ls my eye twitching?
- It look fine.

1051
00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:53.690
- Yeah? Does it look fine?
- Yeah, fine, man. There's nothing wrong.

1052
00:58:53.880 --> 00:58:56.201
- Let's play a memory game, okay? Engage.
- Yes.

1053
00:58:56.360 --> 00:58:58.840
- Give me 12 months.
- Months.

1054
00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:00.331
One, two...

1055
00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:01.561
- No.
- Four...

1056
00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:03.603
Summer, Christmas...

1057
00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:06.127
- What?
- Baked potato...

1058
00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:08.806
- What is "baked potato"?
- Wait. Did I leave one out?

1059
00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:11.327
No. You're right. You're right.
Those are the months.

1060
00:59:11.640 --> 00:59:13.881
Thanks for driving me to college, Dad.

1061
00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:16.441
What? What the fuck?

1062
00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:20.685
But don't start crying when you drop me
off at the dorm, because then I'll start crying.

1063
00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:23.609
I love you, Dad.

1064
00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:26.564
Love you too, man.

1065
00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:30.249
- This is where I need to get out.
- James! No! No!

1066
00:59:32.920 --> 00:59:34.729
Close the door! Close the door!

1067
00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:37.082
- Are we at Coachella?
- No, James!

1068
00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:45.242
Rita, thank you once again
for taking the knife out of my head.

1069
00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:47.010
Mm.

1070
01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:04.811
Makayla, what...?

1071
01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.240
Young lady.

1072
01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:08.243
But he's doing it.

1073
01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:09.731
This is delicious.

1074
01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:12.931
- Okay, James. James.
- Grr.

1075
01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:16.004
Stop. Stop. You don't have to eat like that.
You're on furlough.

1076
01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:17.491
Mm.

1077
01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:20.565
Sorry. It's part of my training.

1078
01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:23.611
If you let someone mess with your food,
you're a punk.

1079
01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:25.720
It's delicious, though.

1080
01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:28.602
Look, you need to shut this stuff down
right now.

1081
01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:32.003
Do you understand you're gonna get him
killed before he even gets to prison?

1082
01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:34.845
- What are you talking about?
- Darnell's doing a wonderful job.

1083
01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.843
- He's a great teacher.
- See that?

1084
01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.570
And a great friend.

1085
01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:41.844
I just can't figure out
how he ever went to jail in the first place.

1086
01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.365
Gosh, me neither.

1087
01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:47.007
Darnell, have you every shared
with James the story of how you went away?

1088
01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:48.281
No, he hasn't.

1089
01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:50.488
Well, he's not really ready
for that right now.

1090
01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:52.642
And I got Makayla at the table.

1091
01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:56.043
I mean, she's the daughter of a convicted felon.
She's strong.

1092
01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:57.531
- Mm-hm.
- Good point.

1093
01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:00.843
Why don't you tell it? Don't leave out details.

1094
01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:07.130
I'd love to hear it.
I think it could really help me.

1095
01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:10.600
Okay, uh...

1096
01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:14.763
We was just some boys in the hood.

1097
01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:18.527
Me, my man, Ricky, and Doughboy.

1098
01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:22.090
Doughboy's real name was Russell.
We was close, man.

1099
01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:25.409
Thing about Ricky, Ricky was special,
because Ricky had the ticket.

1100
01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:29.804
Ricky was star quarterback.
You know, he had a college future.

1101
01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:31.803
He was our golden boy, you know?

1102
01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:35.328
We got into it with some other guys.
You know, some gangbang stuff.

1103
01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:37.642
Uh, on the way home we decide to split up.

1104
01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:40.488
Me and Doughboy said we'll go this way.

1105
01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:41.971
Ricky said he'll go this way.

1106
01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:45.491
Me and Doughboy come around,
we see Ricky on the ground.

1107
01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:47.771
Ricky got shot.

1108
01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:49.809
I run over there.
I'm running, I'm running.

1109
01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:53.646
I grab him. I got his head on my arm.
I'm looking. I'm like, "Ricky!

1110
01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:03.481
"Ricky."

1111
01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:06.566
He had the ticket!

1112
01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:08.600
They got him.

1113
01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:11.884
Doughboy's like, "Come on, man. Get up.
Let him be. He's done."

1114
01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:13.766
<i>I</i> get UP-

1115
01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:17.288
Doughboy says, "You know what this mean.
This mean we gotta step up."

1116
01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:20.205
I said, "You damn right, it does."
So we strapped up.

1117
01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:23.843
- I don't know what that means.
- It means we got the burners.

1118
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.331
I don't know what that means.

1119
01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:28.404
It means we went and got the guns.

1120
01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:31.321
We saw those guys later that night.

1121
01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:33.721
Three headshots. Pop! Pop! Pop!

1122
01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:37.566
-"That's for Ricky!"
- For sure.

1123
01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:40.440
Cops came, man.

1124
01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:43.962
I told Doughboy I'd take the rap.

1125
01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:48.245
I said, "You go ahead. Live your life.
I'll tell them it was me."

1126
01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:50.728
Cops came. I said, "I did it."

1127
01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:52.325
I went to jail.

1128
01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:59.046
You gave your life and your freedom
for Russell.

1129
01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:01.090
Loyal to a fault.

1130
01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:04.171
It is what it is.

1131
01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:06.408
That's why I wash cars today.

1132
01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:08.050
Because I got blood on my hands.

1133
01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:09.770
Just like Lady Macbeth.

1134
01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:12.607
<i>- Huh?
- Like Macbeth.</i>

1135
01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:13.807
Yes.

1136
01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:16.610
- Yes.
- Phew.

1137
01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:18.000
Wow, what a story.

1138
01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:20.290
Almost sounds like a movie.

1139
01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:22.130
Phew. Yeah.

1140
01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:23.486
Mm-hm.

1141
01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:29.090
Darnell, why don't you tell him about that time
that that white lady came and adopted you...

1142
01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:31.328
and turned you into an offensive tackle.

1143
01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:34.123
I think we've talked enough tonight.

1144
01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:36.163
Oh. There's my cab.

1145
01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:40.610
I'd better get back before lockdown
or Cecelio will put me in the hole.

1146
01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:43.047
He loves putting me in the hole.

1147
01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.367
- Well, let me walk you out, man.
- No, that's fine.

1148
01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:48.841
Thanks for everything.

1149
01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.843
James, it was wonderful meeting you.

1150
01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.126
Great to meet you too.

1151
01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:55.962
You know, growing up, my family
would never spend any time together like this.

1152
01:03:56.360 --> 01:03:57.566
You guys are very lucky.

1153
01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:02.126
- Bye, Makayla.
- Bye, Mr. King.

1154
01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:04.410
Bye-bye.

1155
01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:09.801
Hey, your dad never went to jail, okay?

1156
01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:12.442
I've seen <i>Boyz n the Hood.</i>

1157
01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:15.244
<i>Who showed you Boyz n the Hood?</i>

1158
01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:17.004
Daddy, I don't think he did it.

1159
01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:18.406
Of course he didn't.

1160
01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:21.166
You need to do something
that's really gonna help him.

1161
01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:24.130
He will not last in prison.

1162
01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:26.328
He wouldn't even last in my school.

1163
01:04:57.320 --> 01:04:58.606
Hello, this is James.

1164
01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:01.691
Hey. It's me, Darnell.
Look, man, I've been thinking it over...

1165
01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:05.003
and it might be a good idea to get
you extra protection on the inside.

1166
01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:08.084
So tomorrow we're gonna go over
to my cousin Russell's house. Now listen.

1167
01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:10.481
<i>Russell and his friends,
they're different dudes.</i>

1168
01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:12.210
Very suspicious of outsiders.

1169
01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:15.523
You walking in there, they're probably
gonna think you a cop off the bat.

1170
01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:19.805
So I need you to do something for me
so we don't create any dangerous situations.

1171
01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:21.166
- Dress casually.
- Blackface.

1172
01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:22.526
What the fuck was that?!

1173
01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:25.724
- See you tomorrow.
- James. James.

1174
01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:28.531
James, don't do nothing stupid.
Just dress casual.

1175
01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:13.722
- Nice whip.
- What the hell are you doing?

1176
01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:16.451
- Who you supposed to be dressed like, James?
- Little Wayne.

1177
01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:19.683
- It's what he wore at his last runway show.
- Oh, Lil Wayne.

1178
01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:24.846
You told me I needed to try to fit in, so I
stayed up all last night studying your culture.

1179
01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:27.162
- I'm sorry, what?
- And to those who say jazz...

1180
01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:32.451
is the only indigenous American art form,
I say listen to a little Jay-Z, my friend.

1181
01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:33.931
Oh.

1182
01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:36.481
I forgot the gin and juice.
Should I run back inside?

1183
01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:51.006
Will you stop?

1184
01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:54.008
I'm not trying to appropriate your culture.

1185
01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:56.927
- That's great. I'll tell the others.
- I'm just saying...

1186
01:06:57.080 --> 01:06:59.811
hip-hop is a very sophisticated,
multifaceted subculture...

1187
01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:02.201
that speaks
to all different types of people.

1188
01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:06.331
The music, the fashions,
the attitudes, the beefs...

1189
01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:08.847
The more I read, the more I listened...

1190
01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:12.761
the more I felt connected
to its rich cultural tapestry.

1191
01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:16.248
That is really great. Now, can we please
be done with this conversation?

1192
01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:18.840
Please stop.

1193
01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:23.808
I think I know who killed Tupac.

1194
01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:33.811
- I got next!
- What the fuck?

1195
01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:36.168
- Hello.
- I'm gonna put a cap in yo ass.

1196
01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:38.245
Who the fuck are you?!

1197
01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:41.051
- Yo, he's good. He with me.
- And who the fuck are you, nigga?

1198
01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:43.570
Hey, Russell. Russell!

1199
01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:45.486
Russell.

1200
01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:47.483
Russell! Excuse me.

1201
01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:50.211
Hello. James King,
Senior Fund Manager, Wealthrop Funds.

1202
01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:52.601
- James, come on.
- Excuse me. Right through here.

1203
01:07:55.640 --> 01:08:00.328
Hell no, man. Is this the motherfucker who
you said you had to get ready for prison, man?

1204
01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:06.802
Well, I need protection,
and I'm hoping to join the Crenshaw Kings.

1205
01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:08.200
Are you? Ha-ha-ha.

1206
01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:13.924
I've seen white people before. My probation
officer is white. You know what I'm saying?

1207
01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:17.084
But you, motherfucker, man,
you white as mayonnaise, man. Ha-ha-ha.

1208
01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:22.766
Oh, shit. Maybe in blackface. Who knows?
Ha-ha-ha.

1209
01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:25.964
Hey, listen. I tell you what though.

1210
01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:28.242
You damn sure
got your get-up right, man.

1211
01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:32.121
I mean, camouflage and cheetah print,
that's straight out the gangbanger's handbook.

1212
01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:34.649
Yeah, yeah, like Lil Wayne, right?

1213
01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:36.281
Exactly. Thank you.

1214
01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:38.365
<i>I love it.</i>

1215
01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:40.961
Look, he's not trying
to be a member, okay?

1216
01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:43.851
He just wants you to protect him
while he's on the inside.

1217
01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.731
Like you did for Darnell
when he took the rap for you.

1218
01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:48.247
What?

1219
01:08:50.280 --> 01:08:52.965
We can talk about that another time.

1220
01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:55.121
- Yeah.
- No.

1221
01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:56.645
So let's let that go.

1222
01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:58.245
You remember. You know.

1223
01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:00.920
With what Ricky did and the ticket...

1224
01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:04.847
and you freaked out and Darnell
took control of the situation.

1225
01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:07.646
- Stop.
- Is this motherfucking...?

1226
01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:09.689
<i>Boyz n the Hood, man.</i>

1227
01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:14.767
- This is a bad time.
- Okay, I tell you what, man.

1228
01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:16.291
I tell you what:

1229
01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:18.170
Humor me.

1230
01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:20.004
I'm a fair person.

1231
01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:21.844
And I'm a businessman.

1232
01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:23.850
Clear professional.

1233
01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:26.045
What's your life worth to you?

1234
01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:29.601
- How does a million dollars sound?
- Ha-ha-ha.

1235
01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:31.603
"How does a million dollars sound?"
Ha-ha-ha.

1236
01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:35.006
Hold up, everybody.
Stand back. I'll handle it.

1237
01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:36.605
How does a million dollars sound?

1238
01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:41.049
Million dollars sound like a one with six zeros
behind it with two commas separating them.

1239
01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:44.443
However, from the sound of CNN
and the looks of The Wall <i>Street</i> Journal...

1240
01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:48.889
and everybody else with eyes and ears
go to get they news, you broke, motherfucker.

1241
01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:53.285
Your assets have been frozen
with no chances of thawing anytime soon.

1242
01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:56.011
So you probably got as much or less...

1243
01:09:56.160 --> 01:09:59.528
than this little no-good, manipulative,
degenerate motherfucker...

1244
01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:01.409
right here next to you.

1245
01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:05.042
Which forces me to ask the question,
"Are you fucking with me?"

1246
01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:07.771
You think this a motherfucking game?
You think I'm playing?

1247
01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:09.922
Why would you come up in my hood,
in my house...

1248
01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:13.641
and present yourself as something you not,
offering shit you can't deliver?

1249
01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:16.280
- Did this motherfucker tell you to lie to me?
- Russ.

1250
01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:18.403
Shut the fuck up, man.

1251
01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:23.003
I think, real fast, you need to tell me
what the fuck you gonna do...

1252
01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:25.925
to make me wanna keep motherfuckers
off your ass.

1253
01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:28.962
You're talking to James King.

1254
01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:32.609
Let me create wealth for you.

1255
01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:39.085
So the normal minimum buy-in
to the Nexel Fund is 5 million...

1256
01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:42.562
but I can get you guys in using
a brokerage pocket account.

1257
01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:46.520
In other words, liquidate two bricks of cocaine
and park it right here.

1258
01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:50.964
With the historical performance of the fund,
that's gonna double every three to five years...

1259
01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:54.727
and we're looking at,
mm, $1.2 million easy.

1260
01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:57.929
Ain't no way you're making that much money
without committing a crime.

1261
01:10:58.080 --> 01:10:59.525
With apologies to Balzac.

1262
01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:01.921
What the fuck?
You talking about my ballsack?

1263
01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:05.971
No. What we're gonna do
is we get other people's money...

1264
01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:08.407
who've made an opposite prediction
on the market.

1265
01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:10.961
Okay, we gonna roll on them
and take they money.

1266
01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:13.606
Just how strapped
are these loser motherfuckers?

1267
01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:15.330
Oh, I wouldn't worry.

1268
01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:17.528
I've taken millions from them...

1269
01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:20.490
and they haven't stepped to me yet.

1270
01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:23.043
Loser motherfuckers.

1271
01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:25.883
Damn. Mayo is badass.

1272
01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:29.522
Stock market is gangster. Take what's
yours and fuck the other guy, right?

1273
01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:32.531
Wall Street, man.
Those are the real criminals.

1274
01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:34.722
Those guys get away with murder.

1275
01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:38.009
Wait, man.
You murder people all the time, Black.

1276
01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:40.926
Oh, yeah. Murder's my favorite.

1277
01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:45.561
And they think, "Oh, please, don't kill me."

1278
01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:49.371
I love it. And I'm like, "I'm not gonna kill you."

1279
01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:52.091
They relax, then I'm like,
"Boom, get on the ground now!

1280
01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:54.248
Get on the ground! Get on the ground!"

1281
01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:57.768
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

1282
01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:04.642
- I get excited about murder.
- Don't worry about it.

1283
01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:07.320
I'm... I'm laughing.

1284
01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:14.487
You should know, you did all right this time.

1285
01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:16.250
Your boy, Mayo, is an earner.

1286
01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:18.402
Are you gonna get him some help
on the inside?

1287
01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:19.965
I'll help him.

1288
01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:23.488
But not with us.
You know, inside it's all about color.

1289
01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:24.801
Dude need a white gang.

1290
01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:26.531
A very white gang.

1291
01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:28.849
But I'll put the play together.

1292
01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:41.970
That's the gang I have to join?

1293
01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:43.610
They seem kind of racist.

1294
01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:45.603
Ain't no "kind of." They are.

1295
01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:47.569
That's the Alliance of Whites.

1296
01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:50.087
That's also your only chance
of survival in prison...

1297
01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:53.801
so you need to go in there and you need
to make them believe that you're one of them.

1298
01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:58.171
Matter of fact, call me the N-word. But say it
like you mean it, though. Let me hear it.

1299
01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:00.642
What? No.

1300
01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:04.282
That's the wrong N-word. Come on, James,
I'm giving you a free pass right now.

1301
01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:08.930
In this truck, the N-word is perfectly fine.
Just another word right now. Go ahead.

1302
01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:11.202
That still doesn't feel...

1303
01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:13.767
Let's try this.
What's that place where your leg bends?

1304
01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:15.087
MY knee?

1305
01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:18.011
Okay. And, uh, what noise
does a angry dog make?

1306
01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:20.563
- Grr?
- Put it together, though.

1307
01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:22.370
Knee. Knee-grr.

1308
01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:24.850
- Ow!
- Oh, shit! I'm sorry.

1309
01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:28.681
I am sorry, man, that just happened.

1310
01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:30.450
That literally just happened.

1311
01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:32.409
Wow, I got you good too.

1312
01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:34.289
It just, like, jumped out, man.

1313
01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:36.283
It was a reflex. I really can't tell you.

1314
01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:38.442
I didn't even say it.
I was saying two other words.

1315
01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:40.404
I apologize, James.
What do you want me to do?

1316
01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:43.286
Just get your ass out the car
and go in there, act hard.

1317
01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:46.041
Fit in, man. Go ahead.

1318
01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:49.969
Cut the light off! Shit!

1319
01:13:58.640 --> 01:13:59.687
Fuck yeah!

1320
01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:11.967
Spider, you're up.

1321
01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:14.049
Watch and learn, son.

1322
01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:19.646
Hi.

1323
01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:23.127
Um...

1324
01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:26.841
If I could have your attention, please.
I'm just looking for Spider?

1325
01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.331
He's a narc!

1326
01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:34.002
Listen, this relationship
can't just be built around him.

1327
01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:36.128
You got a right to be happy too,
you know?

1328
01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:40.320
<i>And I am, I am. And I think I'm open
to it now because of our talk.</i>

1329
01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:44.485
Yeah. That's good. I love the fact
that you're listening. I love that.

1330
01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:47.484
<i>You know, you're the best boyfriend
I never had.</i>

1331
01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:49.369
Ha, ha. Okay. Ha-ha-ha.

1332
01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:53.370
<i>Yeah, well, I'm not totally giving up.
There is time.</i>

1333
01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:56.205
<i>- And things change with time.
- No, no, they don't.</i>

1334
01:14:56.360 --> 01:14:59.091
No. No, no. That's never gonna happen.

1335
01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:02.210
- You say that now.
- No, no, no. I'm always gonna say that.

1336
01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:04.243
- Okay.
- Ha-ha-ha.

1337
01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:05.447
Okay.

1338
01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:09.046
Oh, shit.

1339
01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:11.726
Hey, <i>I</i> gotta go, Qkay?

1340
01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:13.484
So I'll talk to you later. Have fun.

1341
01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:25.242
Private club, Jew Hair.

1342
01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:28.407
Good one, Spider.

1343
01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:32.201
I walked right into that one. Heh.

1344
01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:35.728
James King. Protestant.

1345
01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:41.160
But Russell,
from the Crenshaw Kings, referred me?

1346
01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:43.322
Yeah, Russell said you'd be by.

1347
01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:46.290
Anyway, I'm going to prison
and I need protection.

1348
01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:48.562
Well, welcome to the club, Jimbo.

1349
01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:50.325
Great! Oh, good!

1350
01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:53.126
But you get protection from us,
we got rules.

1351
01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:55.000
Principles.

1352
01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:57.010
Rule number one:

1353
01:15:57.400 --> 01:16:01.121
When you're on the inside, you don't
hang out with the niggers or the spics.

1354
01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:04.166
Now, do you have a problem
with that, brother?

1355
01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:05.760
Me?

1356
01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:08.930
Of course not.

1357
01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:12.963
Spider, what do you take me for?

1358
01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:15.282
I'm a big-time racist.

1359
01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:17.971
I hate the knee.

1360
01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:19.451
What?

1361
01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:21.401
What is this shit?

1362
01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:26.922
I mean, heck, I'm such a racist
that my chess set, I only have white pieces.

1363
01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:29.043
It's confusing, but I don't...

1364
01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:31.409
I won't give the blacks a chance to win.

1365
01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:33.244
Oh, shit.

1366
01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:35.121
He's a fucking cop.

1367
01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:36.770
- He's a cop!
- I smell bacon.

1368
01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:38.570
- I'm not a cop.
- Fucking hate narcs.

1369
01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:40.330
We'll find out what he is.

1370
01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:46.281
Yeah.

1371
01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:50.126
Oh, God.

1372
01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:52.521
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. Oh, my God.

1373
01:16:56.440 --> 01:17:00.490
I'm just wondering if maybe I'm not
the best fit for the Alliance of Whites.

1374
01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:04.531
You got anything to confess
before I rip your face off?

1375
01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:06.085
Fine! Go ahead!

1376
01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:09.483
Kill me!
But please tell the world I'm not a thief!

1377
01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:11.682
I did not do the things they said I did!

1378
01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:18.491
Promise me, Spider! Promise me!

1379
01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:20.167
Burn him.

1380
01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:27.450
The fuck was that?!

1381
01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:30.571
That's right!

1382
01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:35.521
A black man just came in with a flamethrower,
just like you always knew would happen!

1383
01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:38.526
Yeah!

1384
01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:40.250
The devil in here, bitch!

1385
01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:41.686
And he's a black man.

1386
01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:44.451
Stay yo ass back! Stay back!

1387
01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:46.443
James! Let's go!

1388
01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:47.687
Yeah.

1389
01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:50.364
- You all right?
- Yeah. Come on.

1390
01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:52.603
Come on. Come on, let's go.

1391
01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:57.329
You know what? I got something
I wanna say to y'all since I'm guessing...

1392
01:17:57.520 --> 01:18:01.081
this is the first time that you've ever
been forced to listen to a black man.

1393
01:18:01.240 --> 01:18:03.720
You know, maybe you guys
should just calm the fuck down.

1394
01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:05.609
Black people ain't trying to hurt you!

1395
01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:07.849
I mean, technically, I am right now.

1396
01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.561
But that's only because of what you
were trying to do to the white guy.

1397
01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:12.767
Think about that!

1398
01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:15.169
Google "I Have a Dream," assholes!

1399
01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:18.321
It's a teachable moment here, people.

1400
01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:20.644
Should burn everybody in here.

1401
01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:26.686
Run, James!

1402
01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:30.364
- Oh, shit!
- Bring me their fucking heads!

1403
01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:32.204
Run, James! Run!

1404
01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:36.085
What the fuck
are you knocking over the bike for?! Run!

1405
01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:39.409
Oh, God. You just couldn't say "nigger", huh?

1406
01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:42.245
What?! You can't see the irony
in being mad at me about that?

1407
01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:44.124
- No!
- Motherfuckers!

1408
01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:48.967
- It's Nazi titties!
- And they're huge!

1409
01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:53.611
Get out!

1410
01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:55.567
Oh, shit!

1411
01:18:55.720 --> 01:18:57.722
- Whoa!
- Bitch, get your white ass off!

1412
01:18:58.200 --> 01:18:59.281
Goddamn it! Ugh!

1413
01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:02.371
Oh, go, go, go!

1414
01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:06.044
- You blew up my club, Jew Hair!
- Oh, shit!

1415
01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:08.009
Post-racial America, assholes!

1416
01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:10.686
- Fuck you, Nazis!
- Yeah!

1417
01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:17.526
I'm so glad to be back in Crenshaw
where it's safe.

1418
01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:22.800
My heart is just now finally settling.

1419
01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:25.645
Yeah. We're alive.

1420
01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:29.247
How about we make a toast
to escaping fucking Nazis.

1421
01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:31.368
Yes. Heh.

1422
01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:39.609
You really are innocent, aren't you?

1423
01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:40.801
Yes.

1424
01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:43.642
- Absolutely.
- Okay, so James, if that's the case...

1425
01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:46.366
then why aren't you trying to find
the guy that framed you?

1426
01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:48.124
We are.

1427
01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:49.800
Who are?

1428
01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:54.087
Now, Martin has a team of investigators
working around the clock.

1429
01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:57.847
He's keeping me up to date.
But the million-dollar question is:

1430
01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:01.083
- Who falsified my transaction records?
- All right, lay it on me.

1431
01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:03.811
All right. Now, this is very complicated
to follow.

1432
01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:07.442
I don't expect you to get it on the first pass,
so listen very carefully.

1433
01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:10.080
The one thing you need to understand
at the Wealthrop Fund...

1434
01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:12.931
is that everything
flows through Martin.

1435
01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:14.525
"Okay?
"Okay.

1436
01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:17.365
Any sort of contact
with the clearing house, the traders...

1437
01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:20.330
access to trading records
and client information...

1438
01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:22.482
international accounts, institutions...

1439
01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:27.168
and, of course, the doling out
of commissions all goes through Martin.

1440
01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:30.723
- So it's Martin.
- No.

1441
01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:33.486
Are you fucking ki...?
It's common sense, James.

1442
01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:36.809
Look! All arrows point to Martin!

1443
01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:39.725
The only name on the board
is fucking Martin!

1444
01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:41.241
Martin! Martin! Martin!

1445
01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:44.441
Come on! James, you need to focus.

1446
01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:47.046
You're going to prison
unless you can prove that Martin did it.

1447
01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:49.089
We'd need to get a hold
of the master records...

1448
01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:52.045
which is a log of all transactions
made by anyone in the firm.

1449
01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:54.891
- Okay, how do we get it?
- Martin has the original copy...

1450
01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:57.805
on the same computer that he had
when he started the company.

1451
01:20:57.960 --> 01:21:00.566
You got to be the dumbest genius I've...
Get up, James!

1452
01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:03.728
- All right.
- Fuck the board! Let's go, James!

1453
01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:05.410
We're going to Martin's office.

1454
01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:15.249
Act natural, James.
You walking like you guilty.

1455
01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:17.882
- Hey, big guy, you catch the game?
- Yeah.

1456
01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:20.884
Hey, big guy, my name is Ken.
I work here.

1457
01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:29.845
It's in this cabinet.

1458
01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.970
We just have to figure out a way
to get the door open.

1459
01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:34.610
Watch out.

1460
01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:37.441
I got it.

1461
01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:41.561
Ugh. There it is. Same computer he had
when he started the company.

1462
01:21:41.720 --> 01:21:42.767
It's a good luck charm.

1463
01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:44.206
Good luck charm, my ass.

1464
01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:48.365
It has no connection to the outside world.
No emails, no internet, no trace.

1465
01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:51.967
There it is. The master records.

1466
01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:54.771
That's what we need.
This will clear my name.

1467
01:21:54.920 --> 01:21:56.684
Well, then let's not waste time. Get it.

1468
01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:01.771
Yes! I'm not going to prison.

1469
01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:04.482
More importantly,
I'm not gonna be anyone's bitch.

1470
01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:06.802
Hey, you are living the dream, my friend.

1471
01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:08.923
- Darnell?
- Yeah?

1472
01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:10.320
Look, you saved my life.

1473
01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:13.530
- I don't know how I'll ever repay you.
- Oh, come on, man.

1474
01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:18.206
Just this once.

1475
01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:23.691
All right, break it up.

1476
01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:28.241
Leave the cart there and back away.
Move away, come on. Move, move.

1477
01:22:29.240 --> 01:22:32.050
I actually respect you for trying,
but enough is enough, James.

1478
01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:33.687
All right.

1479
01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:37.371
What are you doing?

1480
01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:39.491
James, what are you doing?

1481
01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:40.841
Don't mad-dog, James.

1482
01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:44.731
He's gonna shoot us.

1483
01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:46.480
What the fuck?!

1484
01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:48.921
No. He's gonna kill us, man.

1485
01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:51.003
- Do you want some?!
- Oh, fuck!

1486
01:22:51.160 --> 01:22:52.889
- Do you wanna step with me?!
- God!

1487
01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:54.407
You'd better... Don't...

1488
01:22:56.280 --> 01:22:57.327
Oh.

1489
01:22:57.480 --> 01:22:59.005
The gun! Grab the gun!

1490
01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:01.168
Huh? _Why don't you
pick up the g I un.

1491
01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:02.367
Uh...

1492
01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:04.090
- Grab it!
- Yeah. I got it, I got it!

1493
01:23:04.520 --> 01:23:06.602
I got it. Yeah, I got it.

1494
01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:11.171
You look a little nervous.
First time holding a gun?

1495
01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:12.647
Nope.

1496
01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:15.281
Motherfucker, freeze!

1497
01:23:15.560 --> 01:23:17.164
Before I pop yo ass!

1498
01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:18.481
"Pop"? Really?

1499
01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:21.251
I would listen to him.
This man's a dangerous felon.

1500
01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:25.001
Yeah, except when I ran his record,
it was the cleanest one I'd ever seen.

1501
01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:27.006
Not even a parking ticket.

1502
01:23:27.720 --> 01:23:29.768
- Yeah.
- What?

1503
01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:32.446
You didn't know? Yeah.

1504
01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:35.683
Stop clicking around and give me the gun.
Come on. Give me the gun.

1505
01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:38.565
I think you have the safety on.

1506
01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:40.525
Shit! OW.

1507
01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:42.166
Ugh.

1508
01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:44.527
See? Safety's on.

1509
01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:46.287
Safety off.

1510
01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:52.246
Martin was right. You are a lucky little shit.

1511
01:23:55.520 --> 01:23:58.285
Don't give me reason to find you again.
Either of you.

1512
01:24:05.720 --> 01:24:07.688
Don't you mad-dog me, James.

1513
01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:11.128
Listen, listen,
I got some explaining to do. James!

1514
01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:13.851
We can talk about this
after we go catch this guy.

1515
01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:15.047
You traitor!

1516
01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:17.646
-"Traitor"?
- Everything you taught me was a lie!

1517
01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:19.929
And now I'm fucked
beyond all fucktitude!

1518
01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:23.163
My life's asshole is fucked!

1519
01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:26.130
You stop with your unorthodox style
of cussing!

1520
01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:27.845
You just remember:

1521
01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:31.169
Whatever happens to me in there,
it's your fault!

1522
01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:32.845
Oh, stop. That's bullshit, man.

1523
01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:36.681
Okay, I may have lied to you about going
to jail, but I did my job. I got you ready!

1524
01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:37.927
Ready for what?!

1525
01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:41.171
Maximum-bullshit prison?

1526
01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:44.682
I almost sucked a dick because of you!

1527
01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:47.051
I don't even give a shit.

1528
01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:51.929
It's my sign.

1529
01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:04.682
Now, the great thing about an IRA, if you need
the money for education or a first home...

1530
01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:07.366
motherfuckers can make withdrawal
penalty-free.

1531
01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:11.804
I honestly don't get the difference
between Roth and the traditional IRAs.

1532
01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.924
Fuck is wrong with you?
The shit is pretax.

1533
01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:17.647
No, it's okay.
A lot of people get confused by that.

1534
01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:19.729
This bitch is gonna mess around,
get us audited.

1535
01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:22.526
- Say what you mean.
- You got five years' receipts, motherfucker?

1536
01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:25.644
And the strip club ain't no home office!

1537
01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:27.529
That's a red flag, nigga!

1538
01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:29.485
You big beanbag-build bitch!

1539
01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:32.881
Stop it! You all friends! Right?

1540
01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:36.000
Now JoJo, you might be right.

1541
01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:37.889
A strip club isn't a home office.

1542
01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:39.724
You're asking to be audited, son.

1543
01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:44.287
But is being right more important
than friendship? Huh?

1544
01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:46.365
Take it from me.

1545
01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:48.449
I lost my black friend.

1546
01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:50.125
Don't lose yours.

1547
01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:52.321
L-lug-

1548
01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:55.402
Hug, motherfuckers!

1549
01:25:56.720 --> 01:25:58.848
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry, man.

1550
01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:02.083
<i>- I'll</i> love you forever.
- Hey, bro, you know, it's just talk.

1551
01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:04.443
Say, cos, you ready to get
put on the hood?

1552
01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:06.284
I'm rolling.

1553
01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:16.609
<i>Mayo, I need you to sink your mind
into this, cos.</i>

1554
01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:21.683
<i>Once you step through this threshold,
motherfuckers are ready to kill for you.</i>

1555
01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:25.765
<i>I mean a whole fraternity of motherfuckers
gonna have your back.</i>

1556
01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:28.969
<i>But there's only one way out of this.</i>

1557
01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:31.731
<i>That's when your casket
drops into the ground.</i>

1558
01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:33.720
<i>So from this day forward...</i>

1559
01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:36.802
<i>you have eternal protection...</i>

1560
01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:39.170
<i>until your eternal demise.</i>

1561
01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:42.522
We dead-ass serious about what we do.

1562
01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:46.004
And if you go through that threshold
and you make it back...

1563
01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:48.401
we gonna be dead-ass serious about you.

1564
01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:51.164
Time to smoke some fools.

1565
01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:53.482
Crenshaw Kings for life, motherfucker.

1566
01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:55.762
Hmm. Almost.

1567
01:26:56.080 --> 01:26:57.320
Let's roll.

1568
01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:01.087
Hey.

1569
01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:02.720
You come back safe.

1570
01:27:02.920 --> 01:27:04.365
I will, Shonda.

1571
01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:08.606
- We gotta go, Mayo.
- Bye,baby.

1572
01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:10.171
Let's roll, cos.

1573
01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:14.808
Hold up! Oh, shit! Wait, wait, wait!

1574
01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:16.405
Oh, wait, wait, wait!

1575
01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:19.325
Hey! It's Darnell! It's Darnell!

1576
01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:22.205
- It's Darnell!
- What the fuck are you doing here?

1577
01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:24.687
Shit, cousin!
Man, tell them to put their guns down!

1578
01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:26.530
Man, put them up.

1579
01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:29.567
God!

1580
01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:32.331
What is your problem, man?
What are you doing?

1581
01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:33.720
Man, give us a second.

1582
01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:38.087
I'm blooding in. Crenshaw Kings
are gonna protect me on the inside.

1583
01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:42.165
So you're gonna go and kill somebody, James?
Huh? Have you lost your fucking mind?

1584
01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:44.363
I have to. I don't have a choice.

1585
01:27:44.520 --> 01:27:45.681
That is not true.

1586
01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:49.606
I came here to tell you
we can clear your name, James.

1587
01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:51.330
But you gotta trust me, man.

1588
01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:53.845
We gotta roll, Mayo.

1589
01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:55.331
"Mayo"?

1590
01:27:55.480 --> 01:27:58.404
- Who the fuck is Mayo?
- I'm Mayo. It's my gang name.

1591
01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:01.524
It's short for "Mayonnaise"
on account of my skin color.

1592
01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:02.921
I came up with that.

1593
01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:05.249
- Okay, you wanna go then?
- What?

1594
01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:06.845
- You wanna go?
- What are you doing?

1595
01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:10.129
Putting fingerprints on your gun.
If you go to jail, I'm going to jail with you.

1596
01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:14.644
So before you out there and make a stupid-ass
decision, why don't you think about that?

1597
01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:18.247
There you go.

1598
01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:21.207
That's it? My fingerprints are off that easy?

1599
01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:23.044
Pretty much. Good as new.
Let's roll, Mayo.

1600
01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:28.041
James, you got a choice right now. You got
the right path, you got the wrong path.

1601
01:28:28.200 --> 01:28:29.804
Make the right decision, James.

1602
01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:31.889
Follow your heart, man.

1603
01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:35.642
James, you gotta trust me on this one.

1604
01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:47.286
Oh, my God! I almost did it!
I almost killed a man!

1605
01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:49.090
And I was gonna use this gun.

1606
01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:51.965
James, put that away, man! Stop!

1607
01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:56.965
- What is your problem?
- I don't know.

1608
01:28:57.120 --> 01:28:59.930
They were just encouraging me...

1609
01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:01.525
and they were high-fiving me.

1610
01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:03.643
They're passing me this sticky icky.

1611
01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:06.361
And between the pot and the hos...

1612
01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:08.727
it was just an ambrosia
of primal sensations.

1613
01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:12.965
And for one brief moment,
I knew what my purpose was.

1614
01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:15.248
- Okay, okay.
- Not to mention Russell.

1615
01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:19.928
He's so charismatic. Real natural leader.
Reminds me of a young Ronald Reagan.

1616
01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:22.480
Hey...

1617
01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:25.048
Thank you for coming back for me.

1618
01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:30.442
Thanks for not doing nothing stupid, man.
Let's get out of here.

1619
01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:43.811
All right, so listen to this.

1620
01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:46.611
I figured out that the residue
on Martin's car was saltwater.

1621
01:29:46.760 --> 01:29:50.207
Then I remembered the mileage. I used to
take a picture of the odometer all the time...

1622
01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:53.847
to keep people from accusing me of joyriding.
People do that? That's awful.

1623
01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:58.005
Yeah, you did it like three times. You tried to
get me fired, but thought my name was Andre.

1624
01:29:58.200 --> 01:30:01.204
Anyway, Martin used to drive
the same exact seven miles every day.

1625
01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:04.443
But last week,
he started driving 56 miles every day.

1626
01:30:04.600 --> 01:30:07.410
Fifty-six! So, what I did was,
I checked the map.

1627
01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:10.723
Turns out that's the exact distance
of a round-trip to San Pedro.

1628
01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:13.491
Saltwater, ocean, San Pedro.

1629
01:30:13.640 --> 01:30:17.486
I just gotta figure out why he's going to
San Pedro. That's the only thing I don't know.

1630
01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:19.409
His yacht.

1631
01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:20.931
It's docked at the port.

1632
01:30:21.080 --> 01:30:23.890
- Fucker's got a yacht?
- Mm-hm. And an island in Cape Verde...

1633
01:30:24.040 --> 01:30:27.806
where there are no extradition laws.
Fucker's got a yacht and a island, James?

1634
01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:30.361
Fucking working for a villain
in a James Bond movie!

1635
01:30:31.080 --> 01:30:32.809
He's gonna make a run for it.

1636
01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:35.004
Not if Mayo can stop him.

1637
01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:39.888
Mayo and Chocolat.

1638
01:30:40.040 --> 01:30:41.849
-"Chocolat"?
- Chocolat.

1639
01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:45.288
- Is that supposed to be my nickname?
- That's your nickname.

1640
01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:49.241
I'll do better. We have the whole car ride.

1641
01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:52.522
Mayo and Coffee.

1642
01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:54.364
Mayo and Fudge.

1643
01:30:54.520 --> 01:30:57.763
- I don't want one. Just call me Darnell.
- Hit it, Fudge!

1644
01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:11.607
There it is. There's his boat.
The Sea Note.

1645
01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:15.406
<i>The Sea Note? What</i> a <i>dick.</i>

1646
01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:17.485
Come on.

1647
01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:21.129
Get down, James. You gotta get down.

1648
01:31:22.920 --> 01:31:24.809
- Are those guards?
- I think so.

1649
01:31:24.960 --> 01:31:26.371
- There's a lot of them.
- Yeah.

1650
01:31:27.560 --> 01:31:28.607
There's the computer.

1651
01:31:30.280 --> 01:31:31.406
I see it.

1652
01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:36.010
James, you gotta get low!

1653
01:31:43.200 --> 01:31:47.091
- Oh, no. They're getting ready to leave.
- Shit. We gotta jump.

1654
01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:48.811
All right.

1655
01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:51.167
- Get off my hand!
- Sorry, I'm nervous.

1656
01:31:51.480 --> 01:31:52.641
Let's go!

1657
01:31:58.640 --> 01:32:00.244
Darnell! I made it!

1658
01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:08.723
Let go of my face!

1659
01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:11.361
- That's all you, James. All you, James!
- Aah!

1660
01:32:35.160 --> 01:32:37.686
Okay. Come on, this way.

1661
01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:45.409
There it is.

1662
01:32:46.720 --> 01:32:49.530
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.
Oh, shit!

1663
01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:55.890
Get off! Get off!

1664
01:32:56.160 --> 01:32:57.207
Get off.

1665
01:32:58.800 --> 01:33:00.040
Dammit.

1666
01:33:01.520 --> 01:33:02.885
This is the end, guys.

1667
01:33:03.440 --> 01:33:04.521
You going down.

1668
01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:08.407
That's great.
I spend my whole life in Crenshaw...

1669
01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:11.729
and now I'm about to get killed
by some white guy from Beverly Hills?

1670
01:33:11.880 --> 01:33:13.928
- On a yacht!
- I'm so sorry.

1671
01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:15.650
Hand over the computer, James.

1672
01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:17.882
Come on.
Just can't get it through your head?

1673
01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:21.408
Guys like you will always be the fall guy
because you're weak.

1674
01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:28.691
Are you okay?

1675
01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:32.083
James? James. No. James, please.

1676
01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:34.447
Goddamn, James.
Please, please, James.

1677
01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:38.082
I sentence you to 'IO years
in a maximum security prison.

1678
01:33:38.240 --> 01:33:39.480
You about to get this:

1679
01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:41.762
Oh, they be fucking in San Quentin.

1680
01:33:41.920 --> 01:33:43.843
- In this house?
- Mouth full of balls.

1681
01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:45.604
- Come back, Mayo.
- Take it all.

1682
01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:48.280
When life puts a dick in your mouth,
you make dickade.

1683
01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:49.930
Go suck a dick.

1684
01:33:50.280 --> 01:33:51.805
Your capoeira's strong!

1685
01:33:51.960 --> 01:33:54.440
Now you must bring your power
into the world.

1686
01:33:58.920 --> 01:34:01.082
What? James. What are you doing?

1687
01:34:01.280 --> 01:34:02.964
I've been pushed around for too long.

1688
01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:05.726
Now it is time. I can feel it.

1689
01:34:05.960 --> 01:34:07.928
- Time for what, James?
- Protect the computer!

1690
01:34:08.280 --> 01:34:10.123
Shit! I don't want the computer!

1691
01:34:10.720 --> 01:34:12.085
<i>Béngéo</i> kick!

1692
01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:22.247
Oh, God!

1693
01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:26.601
Oh, shit!

1694
01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:30.802
Leave me alone! Stop! No!

1695
01:34:31.880 --> 01:34:33.644
James! James!

1696
01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:47.644
All right, get down there. Come on.

1697
01:35:00.800 --> 01:35:03.406
Mayo and Chocolat, motherfuckers!

1698
01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:06.723
Aah! James, you mean to tell me
you could do this shit the whole time?

1699
01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:09.850
Capoeira must never be used
unless capoeira is required.

1700
01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:11.047
Let's go.

1701
01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:14.683
Motherfuckers!

1702
01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:19.805
Okay! Okay!

1703
01:35:22.840 --> 01:35:24.330
Come here!

1704
01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:26.802
That's what we do!

1705
01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:29.046
Mother...! Get off!

1706
01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:33.361
James.

1707
01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:36.124
Do like we used to do in the yard.

1708
01:35:37.800 --> 01:35:39.529
Yeah! You got it, James.

1709
01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:43.210
Fuck yeah, James. Get his ass, James.

1710
01:35:50.760 --> 01:35:51.886
God.

1711
01:35:54.960 --> 01:35:56.041
I got the computer.

1712
01:35:56.200 --> 01:35:57.565
- Lifeboat. Come on.
- All right.

1713
01:35:57.720 --> 01:35:59.961
Hey, that capoeira shit was amazing.

1714
01:36:00.120 --> 01:36:03.044
But you learned some of that shit
from me too. Right, James?

1715
01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:06.409
James. What's going on here?
What the hell did you do to my boat?

1716
01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:07.686
Man, fuck this boat!

1717
01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:11.049
We taking the evidence that you framed
your son-in-law with, sick son of a bitch.

1718
01:36:11.240 --> 01:36:13.925
How could you do this to me, Martin?
Ten years in prison?

1719
01:36:14.120 --> 01:36:16.566
James, you realize
that I didn't mean to hurt you.

1720
01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:19.087
I'm very fond of you,
but Himalayan Tiger tanked...

1721
01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:23.450
and I had to get the money from somewhere.
I had no choice. It was you or me.

1722
01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:25.125
That sounds like a choice!

1723
01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:28.409
James, fuck him. We're leaving.

1724
01:36:28.560 --> 01:36:31.769
And next time you wanna store
some fraud shit, get an iPad.

1725
01:36:31.920 --> 01:36:32.921
Come on, James.

1726
01:36:34.240 --> 01:36:36.163
- Oh, my damn.
- Alissa.

1727
01:36:36.360 --> 01:36:39.887
- James. Daddy, what's he doing here?
- It's fine, honey.

1728
01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:41.287
Uh, James.

1729
01:36:41.480 --> 01:36:45.121
I have a wonderful idea.
Why don't you come with us?

1730
01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:49.331
We'll start a whole new life in Cape Verde
and nobody has to go to prison.

1731
01:36:49.480 --> 01:36:50.686
Don't you want...

1732
01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:54.521
a big, big island?

1733
01:36:55.880 --> 01:36:58.451
- Were you in on this?
- No, not at first.

1734
01:36:58.600 --> 01:37:01.683
And when he told me about it,
I was really mad at him.

1735
01:37:01.880 --> 01:37:04.770
But then he explained how he was able
to hide most of the money...

1736
01:37:04.960 --> 01:37:06.450
so, really, there's no harm done.

1737
01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:11.123
James, now there's still time
to get everything you want.

1738
01:37:11.800 --> 01:37:13.609
Everything.

1739
01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:16.965
No! I don't want any of it.

1740
01:37:17.960 --> 01:37:20.281
- And you got a white girl's ass.
- Ah!

1741
01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:24.729
Thattaboy. Hey, James, do you wanna
switch off, man? I got nothing left up top.

1742
01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:30.647
- Quick, throw it in the Zodiac.
- Right. Then we can get the fuck out of here.

1743
01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:35.210
- Shit! Goddamn it!
- Aah!

1744
01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:38.804
I am genuinely sorry it had to end this way.

1745
01:37:38.960 --> 01:37:41.327
When we clear the breakwater, shoot them.

1746
01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:43.729
You ain't got to do this, man.

1747
01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:46.005
You ain't got to do this.

1748
01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:50.051
Well, Dad, looks like you thought
of everything, didn't you?

1749
01:37:50.560 --> 01:37:52.642
You were always one step ahead of me.

1750
01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:56.166
Except you forgot one little detail.

1751
01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:02.321
Where'd that come from?

1752
01:38:02.520 --> 01:38:04.522
First rule in prison pat-downs:

1753
01:38:04.680 --> 01:38:06.728
Always check the anus.

1754
01:38:08.160 --> 01:38:09.685
Someone learned how to keister.

1755
01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:13.401
- Ew.
- That's right. Nuts and butts.

1756
01:38:14.840 --> 01:38:17.081
You point? Okay.
That's how you wanna do it?

1757
01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:18.884
You point at him. I'll point at Martin.

1758
01:38:19.040 --> 01:38:20.849
Either way. So if I die, Martin's going.

1759
01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:24.049
So you figure it out.
Shoot me, Martin gets shot.

1760
01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:25.846
Ball's in your court, Gayle.

1761
01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:28.128
- Alissa?
- Shoot her.

1762
01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:30.681
Shoot her.
You need to shoot that bitch anyway.

1763
01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:32.041
You're not gonna shoot me.

1764
01:38:32.360 --> 01:38:34.727
You're wasting time.
Police'll be here any second.

1765
01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:37.360
That's right.
We're talking the real police.

1766
01:38:37.520 --> 01:38:40.285
The ones that's gonna come here
on boats with sirens on them...

1767
01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:42.881
that's got dogs that can swim. Let me
tell you something about swimming dogs.

1768
01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:45.646
Now, let me tell you,
you're gonna bullshit a bullshitter...

1769
01:38:45.800 --> 01:38:47.768
just make the bullshit plausible.

1770
01:38:47.920 --> 01:38:50.810
<i>This is the U. S. Marshall Service.
Prepare to be boarded.</i>

1771
01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:52.570
<i>You are carrying a fugitive.</i>

1772
01:38:54.040 --> 01:38:55.405
Yes!

1773
01:38:55.560 --> 01:38:56.607
Heh. Hell yeah.

1774
01:38:56.760 --> 01:38:58.000
Oh, shit.

1775
01:38:59.240 --> 01:39:00.287
How?

1776
01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:04.404
Remember this bracelet
that crooked lawyer of yours gave me?

1777
01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:07.962
By my calculation
we should be well outside the county line.

1778
01:39:08.920 --> 01:39:10.922
Prison school's in session, bitch.

1779
01:39:11.960 --> 01:39:13.803
And somebody just graduated.

1780
01:39:13.960 --> 01:39:15.450
That's perfect. That's perfect.

1781
01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:16.931
That's great, right?

1782
01:39:17.080 --> 01:39:19.560
<i>Attention Sea Note.
This is the U.S. Marshal Service.</i>

1783
01:39:19.760 --> 01:39:22.240
- Where you going? Huh, Martin?
- Where you going?

1784
01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:23.931
What?!

1785
01:39:24.080 --> 01:39:25.764
- Look at you, man!
- I know.

1786
01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:27.160
God, look at you!

1787
01:39:27.320 --> 01:39:30.802
Where did you put...? That was in your ass.
That was in your ass.

1788
01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:33.442
<i>The computer proved I was innocent.</i>

1789
01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:37.650
<i>Martin was arrested for fraud, tampering
with evidence and obstruction of justice.</i>

1790
01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:40.724
And I will be contacting my attorney. Daddy?

1791
01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:44.680
<i>As for me, I was cleared of all charges
related to the embezzlement.</i>

1792
01:39:44.920 --> 01:39:46.285
So I guess we did it.

1793
01:39:46.440 --> 01:39:48.090
Mayo and Chocolate.

1794
01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:51.164
- Heh.
- Thank God we won't be needing this anymore.

1795
01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:53.283
This illegal, unlicensed gun.

1796
01:39:53.440 --> 01:39:56.444
- Okay, you should really get rid of that thing.
- Gun!

1797
01:39:57.040 --> 01:39:58.644
- Drop it!
- Oh, shit.

1798
01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:04.082
<i>I did end up getting six months
for carrying an unlicensed weapon.</i>

1799
01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:07.844
<i>But, thanks to Darnell, I was ready.</i>

1800
01:40:08.680 --> 01:40:11.650
<i>Prison is like life distilled to its purest form.</i>

1801
01:40:11.800 --> 01:40:14.690
<i>Give respect to get respect.</i>

1802
01:40:17.320 --> 01:40:23.441
<i>But most of all, if you let someone
fuck with your food, you're a punk fuck bitch.</i>

1803
01:40:24.280 --> 01:40:26.851
Someone should have told you
this Mayo went bad.

1804
01:40:27.080 --> 01:40:28.809
I'm gonna punch you in the fuck!

1805
01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:30.126
I'm gonna shit you!

1806
01:40:30.280 --> 01:40:32.408
Merry Dickmas, Santa Cock!

1807
01:40:34.240 --> 01:40:37.562
<i>Martin didn't do as well.
But he learned a valuable lesson too.</i>

1808
01:40:38.840 --> 01:40:42.003
<i>They be fucking in San Quentin.</i>

1809
01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:44.162
<i>- How</i> ya <i>doing?
- A whole lot of fucking.</i>

1810
01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:45.367
Hey! Open up. Open UP-

1811
01:40:50.680 --> 01:40:53.286
<i>Shonda visited me every day.</i>

1812
01:40:54.080 --> 01:40:57.129
<i>I never thought prison would be the place
I learned to love again...</i>

1813
01:40:57.320 --> 01:40:58.924
<i>but that's what happened.</i>

1814
01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:02.801
No, no, no!
She's not done. She hasn't finished yet.

1815
01:41:03.160 --> 01:41:05.561
No, it's not what you think.
We're in love.

1816
01:41:06.120 --> 01:41:10.603
<i>JAMES". I helped the FBI find and return
all the assets Martin stole.</i>

1817
01:41:10.760 --> 01:41:15.607
<i>In return, they unfroze my bank accounts,
and I knew just where to invest my money.</i>

1818
01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:25.286
It's good?

1819
01:41:25.640 --> 01:41:26.801
It's good, right?

1820
01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:28.883
Makayla, you proud of Daddy?

1821
01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:30.963
Daddy did good? Give me a hug.

1822
01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:37.008
Daddy, I like your car wash.

1823
01:41:37.160 --> 01:41:39.128
I'm glad you like it, sweetie.

1824
01:41:57.480 --> 01:41:59.164
I see you survived.

1825
01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:01.209
I guess you got hard, Mayo.

1826
01:42:01.480 --> 01:42:03.926
No. You made me hard.

1827
01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:06.487
Come here, man. Heh.

1828
01:42:06.680 --> 01:42:07.966
Aah!

1829
01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:09.929
You made me hard.

1830
01:42:10.680 --> 01:42:12.170
So hard.

1831
01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:15.085
You got me so hard.

1832
01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:18.084
I'm happy to see you too, big fella.
I'm happy to see you.

1833
01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:20.766
There was a moment
where I stopped being hard...

1834
01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:24.288
but I thought of you,
and it got me hard again.

1835
01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:26.849
And I can't ever thank you.

1836
01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:28.161
All right.

1837
01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:32.450
Welcome home, man.
Come on, let's get in the car.

1838
01:42:32.640 --> 01:42:34.244
You look good, James.

1839
01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:42.889
Welcome back to the free world, James.
How you wanna celebrate?

1840
01:42:43.040 --> 01:42:46.886
You know what I'd like to get my hands
on? A Wall <i>Street</i> Journal and a 40.

1841
01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:49.168
Now that'd be a perfect Sunday morning.
